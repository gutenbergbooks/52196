</div>

<p>Being desirous of proceeding to Copenhagen, I
landed at Nyeborg; together with the Dane and
his lady.</p>

<p>The steamer across to Korsör will start at
four <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and so, it being now midnight, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
sleep as fast as we can till then. The politeness of
the Danish custom-house officials surpassed everything
of the kind I ever encountered from that
class. We put up at Schalburg’s hotel. Mine
host cozened us. I recommend no traveller to
stop at his house of entertainment.</p>

<p>“Morgen-stund giv Guld i Mund,” said the fair
Dane to me, quoting a national proverb, as I
pointed out to her the distant coast of Zealand,
which a few minutes before was indistinctly visible
in the grey dawn, now gilded with the sun.</p>

<p>She was quite in ecstasies at the thoughts of
setting foot on her dear Zealand, and seeing its
level plains of yellow corn and beechen groves,
after the granite and gneiss deserts of Lapland and
Finmark. Sooth to say, the Danish ladies are
not infected with that deadly liveliness which characterizes
many of the Norwegians; while, on the
other hand, they are devoid of that bland facility
and Frenchified superficiality which mark many of
the Swedes. How is it that there is such a wide
distinction between the Swede and the Norskman?
Contrast the frank bluffness of the one; strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sterling, and earnest, without artifice and grace:
and the supple and insinuating manner of the
other. The very peasant-girl of Sweden steps like
a duchess, and curtsies as if she had been an
<i>habitué</i> of Almack’s. Pass over the Borders, as I
have done, from Trondjem Fjord through Jemte-land,
and at the first Swedish change-house
almost, you are among quite a different population,
profuse of compliments and civilities which they
evidently look upon as all in the day’s work, and
very much disposed withal to have a deal with you&mdash;to
sell you, for instance, one of their grey dog-skin
cloaks for one hundred rix dollars. One is reminded,
on the one hand, of the sturdy, blundering
Halbert Glendinning; and on the other, of the
lithesome, adroit Euphuist, Sir Piercie Shaftón.
And yet, if we are to believe the antiquarians and
ethnologists, both people are of pretty much the
same stock: coming from the countries about the
Black Sea, two centuries after Christ, when these
were overrun by the Romans, and supervening
upon the old Gothic or second migration. It
may be said that the Norsk character caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
some parts of its colouring from the stern, rugged
nurse in the embrace of whose mountains their
lot has been cast; with the great backbone
of primæval rock (Kiölen) splitting Norway in
two, and rendering intercourse difficult. So that
now you will hear a Norskman talk of Nordenfjelds
(north of the mountains), and Söndenfjelds
(south of the mountains), as if they were two
distinct countries. But then, if the Swedes did
live on a flatter country, and one apparently more
adapted for the production of the necessaries of
life, and so more favourable to the growth of
civilization; yet it, too, presented obstacles almost
equally insurmountable to the spread of refining
arts and tastes.</p>

<p>They also used to talk, not like the Norwegians,
of their north of the mountain and south of the
mountain, but of their north of the forest (nordenskovs)
and south of the forest (söndenskovs), in
allusion to the impenetrable forests of Kolmorden
and Tiveden, which divided the district about the
Mälar Lake from the south and south-west of
Sweden. And is it much better now? True, you
have the canal that has pierced the country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
opened it out to culture and civilization; but even
at the present day the climate of Sweden is less
mild than that of Norway, and four-sevenths of the
whole surface of the country are still covered by
forests. In travelling from the Trondjem Fjord to
the Gulf of Bothnia, I found myself driving for
four consecutive days through one dense forest,
with now and then a clearing of some extent; and
as for the marshes, they are very extensive and
treacherous. One day I saw two cranes not far from
the road along which I was driving, and immediately
stepped, gun in hand, off the causeway, to
try and stalk them. But I was nigh becoming the
victim; for at the first step on what looked like a
grassy meadow, I plunged deep into a floating
morass. A Swede who was my companion luckily
seized me before I had played out the part of
Curtius without any corresponding results.</p>

<p>The nation which has to fight with a cold
climate and such physical geography as this, is
not much better situated than the one which in a
milder climate has to wring a subsistence from
rocks, and which, to advance a mile direct, has to
go up and down twain. Like those heroes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pioneers of civilization in the backwoods, they
both of them have to clench the teeth, and knit the
brow, and stiffen the sinews, if they want to hold
their own in the stern fight with nature. And this
sort of permanent, self-reliant obduracy which
by degrees gets into the blood, is by no means
prone to foster those softer graces that bud
forth under the warmth of a southern sky and
in the lap of a richer soil, where none of the
asperities generated by compulsion are requisite,
but Dame Nature, with the least coaxing possible,
listens to and rewards her suitors.</p>

<p>Why is it, then, that the manners of these two
people are so different? People tell me it did not
use to be so. The first and great reason, then,
appears to be the different governments of the two
countries; the absence of liberty and the excessive
powers and number of the nobility in the one,
and the abundance of liberty and absence of nobles
in the other. The influence of rule upon the
inhabitants of a country is, in the long run, as
mighty as that of breed and blood.</p>

<p>Improbable as it may appear to some, I am
inclined to lay great stress on the influence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
French Court. Bernadotte, it is true, was the son
of a plebeian, a notary of Pau; but he was a
Frenchman, and every Frenchman is versatile, and
gifted with external polish, at all events; and his
Court was French, and Court influence did its
work, penetrating to the very roots of society; so
that by degrees the graces of the capital became
engrafted on the obsequious spirit already engendered
by long servitude among the Swedish population.
At Christiania, on the contrary, there is no
Court; the nobility are not, and the country is
all but a republic. This is, I believe, a part
solution of the problem&mdash;a “guess at truth.”
While on this subject, I may as well refer to the
difference between the pronunciation of Danish
and Norwegian, though they are at present the
same language. The vapid sweetness which your
Dane affects in his articulation, is most distasteful
after the rough and strenuous tongue of Norway.
It is a case of lollipop to wholesome gritty rye-bread.
The Dane, especially the Copenhagener,
rolls out his words in a most lackadaisical manner,
as if he were talking to a child. Mammas and
papas will talk thus, we know, to their babies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
language of endearment not being according to
the rules of the Queen’s English. At times I
thought great big men were going to blubber, and
were commiserating their own fate or that of the
person addressed, when perhaps they were only
asking what time the train started to Copenhagen,
or whether the potato sickness had reappeared.</p>

<p>Going to the fore part of the steamer to get
some English money turned into Danish, I find
two of those Swiss of the North, Dalecarlian girls,
on board. They are from Mora, and one is very
pretty. The most noticeable feature in their costume
is their short petticoats and red stockings.
That most sprightly girl, Miss Diana Redshank,
will at once perceive whence it is that we borrow
the fashion now prevailing in England. As
a matter of course, they were artists in hair,
and they immediately produced their stock-in-trade&mdash;viz.,
specimens of bracelets, necklaces, and
watch-chains, very well worked and very cheap.
They have been from home all the summer, and
are now working their way back. In winter they
weave cloth and attend to the household duties.
I bought a hair bracelet for three shillings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>As an instance of Norwegian slowness, I may
mention that although the railway is opened from
Korsör to Copenhagen, distant three hours, the
Norwegian steamer still continues to stop at Nyeborg,
on the further side of the Belt, thereby
necessitating this trip across, and much additional
delay, trouble, and expense.</p>

<p>The novels of Ingemann have made all these
places classic ground. The Danes look on him
as the Walter Scott of their country. He is now
past seventy, and living in repose at the Academy
of Sorö. Denmark sets a good example in the
reward of literary merit.</p>

<p>Well do I remember, years ago, meeting a
goggle-eyed young man, with lanky, dark hair,
ungainly figure, and wild countenance, and nails
just like filberts, at a table-d’hôte in Germany.
All the dinner he rolled about his large eyes in
meditation. This was Hans Christian Andersen,
now enjoying a European reputation, and holding,
with a good stipend, the sinecure of Honorary
Professor at the University of Copenhagen.
Hitherto he had been candle-snuffer at the
metropolitan theatre, but his hidden talents had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been perceived, and he was being sent to Italy to
improve his taste and get ideas at the public
expense.</p>

<p>If we contrast the fate in England and in Denmark
of genius in rags, we may be reminded of
the märchen, told, if I remember, by Andersen
himself, how that once on a time a little dirty duck
was ignored by the sleek fat ducks around, when it
meets with two swans, who recognised the seemingly
dirty little duck, and protected it. Whereupon
the astonished youngster happens to see himself
in a puddle, and finds that he is a genuine swan.</p>

<p>What a contrast between these flat plains of
Zealand, with the whitewashed cottages and farm-houses&mdash;the
ridge of the thatched roof pinned
down with straddles of wood&mdash;and the rocky wilds
of Norway, its log-houses, red or yellow, with
grass-covered roofs, nestling under a vast impending
mountain. In Denmark, the highest land is
only a few hundred feet above the sea. How
immensely large, too, the cows and horses look
after the lilliputian breeds of Norway. There
being hardly any fences, the poor creatures are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
generally tethered: yonder peasant girl with the
great wooden mallet is in the act of driving in
the iron tethering-pin.</p>

<p>No wonder that in a country so open, superstition
has had recourse to terrify the movers of
their neighbour’s landmarks. Thus the Jack-o’-Lanterns
in the isle of Falster are nothing but
the souls of dishonest land-measurers running
about with flaming measuring-rods, and crying,
“Here is the right boundary, from here to here!”
Again, near Ebeltoft, there used to live a rich
peasant, seemingly a paragon of propriety, a
regular church-goer, a most attentive sermon-hearer,
one who paid tithes of all he possessed;
but somehow, nobody believed in him. And sure
enough when he was dead and buried, his voice
was often heard at night crying in woful accents,
“Boundary here, boundary there!” The people
knew the reason why.</p>

<p>Instead of those dark and sombre pine-forests
so thoroughly in keeping with the grim, Dantesque
grandeur of the Norwegian landscape, or the ghostlike
white stems of the birch-trees, the only trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
visible are the glossy-foliaged, wide-spreading
groves of beech, with now and then an oak.</p>

<p>I descend at Ringstedt to see the tombs of the
great Valdemar (King of Denmark), and his two
wives, Dagmar of Bohemia, and Berengaria of
Portugal. The train, I perceive, is partly freighted
with food for the capital, in the shape of sacks
full of chickens (only fancy chickens in sacks!)
and numbers of live pigs, which a man was
watering with a watering-can, as if they had been
roses, and would wither with the heat.</p>

<p>Having a vivid recollection of Ingermann’s best
historical tale, <i>Valdemar Seier</i>, it was with no
little interest that I entered the church, and stood
beside the flag-stones in the choir which marked
the place of the King’s sepulture. On the Regal
tomb was incised, “Valdemarus Secundus Legislator
Danorum.” On either side were stones,
with the inscriptions, “Regina Dagmar, prima
uxor Valdemari Secundi,” and “Regina Berengaria,
secunda uxor Valdemari Secundi.” The
real name of Valdemar’s first wife was Margaret,
but she is only known to the Dane as little
Dagmar, which means “dawning,” or “morning-red.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Her memory is as dear to the people
as that of Queen Tyra Dannebod. She was
as good as she was beautiful. The name of
“Proud Bengard,” on the contrary, is loaded
with curses, as one who brought ruin upon the
throne and country.</p>

<p>At this moment a gentleman approached me with
a courteous bow; he was dressed in ribbed grey and
black pantaloons, and a low-crowned hat. I found
afterwards that he was a native of Bornholm, and
no less a personage than the Probst of Ringstedt;
he was very polite and affable, and informed me
that these graves were opened not long ago in the
presence of his present Majesty of Denmark.
Valdemar was three ells long; his countenance was
imperfect. Bengard’s face and teeth were in good
preservation. Dagmar’s body had apparently been
disturbed before.</p>

<p>In the aisle near, he pointed out the monument
to Eric Plugpenning, the son of Valdemar. He
had the nickname of Plugpenning (Plough-penny),
for setting a tax on the plough. He was murdered
on a fishing excursion by his brother. The fratricide’s
name was not Cain but Abel. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
luck afterwards about the house; the curse of
Atreus and Thyestes rested upon it. Of course,
after such an atrocity King Abel “walks,” or more
strictly speaking he “rides.” Slain in a morass
near the Eyder in 1252, his body was buried in
the cathedral of Sleswig. But his spirit found no
rest; by night he haunted the church and disturbed
the slumbers of the canons; his corpse was
consequently exhumed, and buried in a bog near
Gottorp, with a stake right through it to keep it
down; the peasants will still point out the place.
But it was all to no purpose; a huntsman’s horn is
often heard at night in the vicinity, and Abel,
dark of aspect, is seen scouring away on a small
black horse, with a leash of dogs, burning like
fire.</p>

<p>Here, then, in Denmark, we see the grand Asgaardsreia
of Norway localized, and transferred
from the nameless powers of the invisible world to
malefactors of earth; while in Germany it assumes
the shape of “The Wild Huntsman.”</p>

<p>Returning to the inn, I amused myself till the
next train arrived by looking at the Copenhagen
paper, from which I learn that twenty pairs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
copulerede&mdash;married&mdash;last week, and that there has
been a great meeting of Mormons in the capital.
Such has been the effect of the mission of the
elders in Jutland, that that portion of Denmark is
becoming quite depopulated from emigration to the
city of the Salt Lake. There is also a list of gold,
silver, and bronze articles lately discovered in the
country, and sent to the museum of Copenhagen,
with the amount of payments received by each. In
the precious metals these are according to weight.
One lucky finder gets 72 rix dollars.</p>

<p>By the next train I advance to Roeskilde, which
takes its name from the clear perennial spring of St.
Roe, which ejects many gallons a minute. Baths and
public rooms are established in connexion with it.
But it was the Cathedral that drew me to Roeskilde.
A brick building, in the plain Gothic of Denmark,
it has not much interest in an architectural point
of view; but there are monuments here which I felt
bound to see. Old Saxo Grammaticus, the chronicler
of early Denmark, the interior of whose
study is so graphically described by Ingermann in
the beginning of <i>Valdemar Seier</i>&mdash;he rests under
that humble stone. Here, too, is buried in one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the pillars of the choir, Svend Tveskjaeg, the
father of Canute the Great, who died at the assize
at Gainsborough, in 1014.</p>

<p>Queen Margaret (the Northern Semiramis), who
wore the triple crown of Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway, sleeps behind the altar, under a full-length
monument in white marble more than four centuries
old. It were well if the Scandinavian idea,
now absorbing the minds of thinking men in the
North, were to find a more happy realization than
in her case&mdash;the union, instead of allaying the
hostility with which each nation regarded the
other, only serving to perpetuate embroilments.
Some good kings and great repose here; also some
wicked and mean. Among the former, it will
suffice to mention Frederick IV., whom the Danes
look upon as their greatest monarch. A bronze
statue of him by Thorwaldsen is to be found in
one of the chapels. In the latter category we unhesitatingly
place Christian VII., to whom, in an
evil hour, was married our Caroline Matilda, sister
of George III., who died at the early age of twenty-three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what do the Danes think now of Matilda?”
inquired I of a person of intelligence.</p>

<p>“Oh, they say ‘Stakkels Matilda!’” (unfortunate
Matilda), was the touching but decisive reply. So
that by the common voice of the people her memory
is relieved from the stain cast upon it by those
who were bound to protect her, the vile Queen-mother
and the good-for-nothing King.</p>

</div>

<p>It was late in the evening when the third train of
the day whisked us into Copenhagen, where I took
up my abode at a quiet hotel near the ramparts.</p>

<p>What a strange place this is. Works of art,
and museums superior to anything in Europe, and
streets, for the most part very paltry, and infamously
paved. Traveller, be on your guard. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
trottoirs of granite slab, worn slippery by the perambulating
hobnails of those children of Amak,
are very treacherous, and if you are supplanted,
you will slide into a gutter nearly a foot deep, full
of black sludge.</p>

<p>These people are a Dutch colony planted by
King Christian II. in the neighbouring island of
Amak.</p>

<p>The original female costume, which they still
retain, consists of little black coalscuttle Quaker
bonnets, very large dark-blue or white aprons, which
almost hide their sober-coloured stuff gowns with
their red and yellow edgings. Their ruddy faces,
at the bottom of the said scuttles, look like hot
cinders got there by mistake. Altogether they are
a most neat, dapper, and cleanly-looking set of
bodies. The men have also their peculiar costume.
These people are the purveyors of vegetables for
Copenhagen. Yon lady, standing in a little one-horse
shay, full of flower-pots and bouquets, is
another specimen of the clan, but seemingly one
of the upper-crust section. Locomotive shops
appear to be the fashion. Near the Church of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Lady are a lot of butchers’ carts drawn up, with
meat for sale. They come from the environs of the
city. Much life is concentred round the bridge
near the palace. In the canal are several little
stumpy sailing boats at anchor, crammed full of
pots and crockery. These are from Bornholm and
Jutland. Near them are some vessels with awnings:
these are depôts of cheeses and butter from
Sleswig and Holstein.</p>

<p>Look at yon row of women with that amphibious
white head-dress spotted brown. In front it looks
like a bonnet; behind, it terminates in a kerchief.
You are reminded by the mixture of another
mongrel, but picturesque article of dress, worn by
the Welsh peasant-women, the pais a gwn bach.
How they are gabbling to those ladies and housekeeper-looking
women, and sparring linguistically
about something in the basket. Greek contending
with Trojan for the dead body of Achilles.</p>

<p>Their whole stock in trade consists of specimens
of “hornfish,” an animal like a sand eel, with long
spiky snout, and of a silvery whiteness. They are
about two feet long, and twenty skillings the pair.
These women are from Helsingör, which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whereabouts of the said fish. They come from
thence every day, if the wind serves; and if it does
not, I fancy they manage to come all the same.</p>

<p>Look at these men, too, in the street, sawing and
splitting away for dear life, a lot of beech logs at
that door. Fuel, I find, is very dear, from seventeen
to twenty dollars the fathom.</p>

<p>Alas! for the poor dogs, victims of that terrible
fear of hydrophobia which seems to infect continental
nations more than England; they are
running about with capacious wire muzzles, projecting
some inches beyond the smeller, which renders
them, it is true, incapable of biting, but also of
exchanging those amiable blandishments and courtesies
with their kind, so becoming and so natural
to them, and forming one of the great solaces of
canine existence.</p>

<p>Yonder is Thorwaldsen’s museum, with its yellow
ochre walls, and frescoes outside representing the
conveyance of his works from Italy hither. But that
is shut up to-day, and besides, everybody has read
an account of this museum of sculpture. An
Englishman is surprised to learn that the sculptor’s
body rests, at his own request, under some ivy-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mould in the quad inside. But the ground,
if not consecrated episcopally, is so by the
atmosphere of genius around.</p>

<p>Let us just pop into this large building opposite.
There is something to be seen here, perhaps, that
will give us an insight into Copenhagen life.</p>

<p>“What is this place, sir?”</p>

<p>“This, sir, is the Royal Assistenz Huus.”</p>

<p>“What may that be?”</p>

<p>“It is a place where needy people can have
money lent on clothes. It enjoys a monopoly to
the exclusion of all private establishments of the
kind. If the goods are not redeemed within a
twelvemonth, they are sold.”</p>

<p>A sale of this kind, I found, was now going on.
Seated at a table, placed upon a sort of dais, were
two functionaries, dressed in brown-holland coats,
who performed the part of auctioneers. One
drawled out the several bids, and another booked
the name and offer of the highest bidder, and very
hot work it seemed to be; the one and the other kept
mopping their foreheads, and presently a Jewish-looking
youth, who had been performing the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
jackal, handing up the articles of clothing, and exhibiting
them to the buyers, brought the two brown-holland
gents a foaming tankard of beer, which
being swallowed, the scribe began scribbling, and
the other Robins drawling again. A very nice pair of
black trousers were now put up: “Better than new;
show them round, Ignatius.” A person of clerical
appearance seized them, and examined them
thoroughly; then a peasant woman got hold of them;
she had very dark eyes and a very red pippin-coloured
face. A broad scarlet riband, passing under
her chin, fastened her lace-bordered cap, while on
her crown was a piece of gold cloth. One would have
thought that the way in which her countenance was
swaddled would have impeded her utterance; but
she led off the bidding, and was quickly followed by
the motley crowd round the platform. But the
clerical-looking customer who had been lying by,
now took up the running, and had it easy. He
marched off in triumph with his prize, and I feel no
doubt that he would preach in them the next Sunday.</p>

<p>Leaving these daws to scramble for the plumes,
I passed into another large room, where I saw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
nice-looking, respectable persons behind a large
counter, examining different articles brought by
unfortunates who were hard up. There was none
of that mixture of cunning, hardness, and brutality
about their demeanour which stamps the officials
of the private establishments of the sort in England.</p>

<p>Hence we go to an old clothes establishment of
another sort&mdash;I mean the Ethnographic Museum.
Here you find yourself, as you proceed from chamber
to chamber, now <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a Greenland family
in their quaint abode; anon you are lower down
Europe among the Laplanders, and among other
little amusements you behold the get-up of a Lap
wizard and his divining drum (quobdas). Hence
you proceed eastward, and are now promenading
with a Japanese beau in his handsome dress of
black silk, now shuddering at the hideous grimaces
of a Chinese deity. All this has been recently
arranged with extraordinary care, and on scientific
principles, by the learned Professor Thomsen.</p>

<p>“Herr Professor,” exclaimed a bearded German,
“can’t we see the Museum of Northern Antiquities
to-day? I have come all the way from
Vienna to see it, and must leave this to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unmöglich, mein Herr,” replied the Professor.
“To-morrow is the day. If you saw it to-day you
would not see the flowers of the collection; and
we will not show it without the flowers. The
most costly and interesting specimens are locked
up, and can’t be opened unless all the attendants
are present.”</p>

<p>“Mais, Mons. Professeur,” put in a French
savan.</p>

<p>“C’est impossible,” replied the Professor,
shrugging up his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Could not we just have a little peep at it, sir?”
here asked some of my fair countrywomen, in
wheedling accents.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, ladies, but this is not the day,
you know. I shall be most happy to explain all
to-morrow, at four o’clock,” was the reply of the
polyglot Professor.</p>

<p>It would be well if the curators of museums in
England would have the example of Professor
Thomsen before their eyes. There is no end to
his civility to the public, and to his labours in the
departments of science committed to his care.
Speaking most of the European languages, he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be seen, his Jove-like, grizzled head towering above
the rest, listening to the questions of the curious
crowd, and explaining to each in their own tongue
in which they were born the meaning of the divers
objects of art and science stored up in this palace.
Next day, I found him engaged in lionizing a big-wig;
at least, so I concluded, when I perceived
that, on either breast, he wore a silver star of the
bigness of a dahlia flower of the first magnitude;
while his coat, studded with gold buttons, was
further illustrated by a green velvet collar. Subsequently
I learned, what I, indeed, guessed, that he
was a Russian grandee on his travels. He is the
owner of one of the best antiquarian collections in
Europe. Professor Thomsen, not to be outdone,
likewise exhibited four orders. While the Muscovite
examined the various curiosities of the stone,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the
bronze, and the iron period, I heard him talking
with the air of a man whose mind was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
made up about the three several migrations from
the Caucasus of the Celts, Goths, and Sclavonians.</p>

<p>An Englishman, when he sees this wonderful
collection, cannot but be struck with astonishment,
on the one hand, at the industry and tact of
Professor Thomsen, who has been the main instrument
in its formation; and with shame and
regret, on the other, that Great Britain has
no collection of strictly national antiquities at
all to be compared with it; and, what is more,
it is daily being increased. The sub-curator,
Mr. C. Steinhauer, informed me, that already,
this year, he had received and added to the
museum one hundred and twenty different batches
of national antiquities, some believed to date as far
back as before the Christian era. And then, the
specimens are so admirably arranged, that you
may really learn something from them as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
state of civilization prevailing in Scandinavia at
very remote periods: the collection being a connected
running commentary or history, such as
you will meet with nowhere else. Observe this oak
coffin, pronounced to be not less than two thousand
years old; and those pieces of woollen cloth of the
same date. Look at that skeleton of a stag’s head,
discovered in the peat.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in that,” says an Hibernian,
fresh from Dublin. “Did you ever see the great
fossil elk in Trinity College Museum?”</p>

<p>Ay! but there is something more interesting
about this stag’s head, nevertheless. Examine it
closely. Imbedded in the bone of the jaw, see,
there is a flint arrow-head; the bow that sped
that arrow must have been pulled by a nervous
arm. This “stag that from the hunter’s aim had
taken some hurt,” perhaps retreated into a
sequestered bog to languish, and sunk, by his
weight, into the bituminous peat, and was thus
embalmed by nature as a monument of a very
early and rude period.</p>

<p>Presently we get among the gold ornaments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
There the Irishman is completely “shut up.” “The
Museum of Trinity College,” and “Museum of
the Royal Irish Academy,” are beaten hollow.
Nay, to leave no room for boasting, facsimiles of
the gold head and neck ornaments in Dublin are
actually placed here side by side with those discovered
in Denmark. The weight of some of the
armlets and necklets is astonishing. Here is a
great gold ring, big enough for the waist; but
it has no division, like the armlets, to enable the
wearer to expand it, and fit it to the body; moreover,
the inner side presents a sharp edge, such as
would inconvenience a human wearer.</p>

<p>“That,” said Professor Thomsen, seeing our
difficulty, “must have been the waistband of an
idol; which, as there was no necessity for taking
it off, must have been soldered fast together, after
it had once encircled the form of the image.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can be the meaning of these pigmy
ornaments and arms?” said I.</p>

<p>“Why, that is very curious. You know the
ancient Scandinavian chieftain was buried with
his sword and his trinkets. This was found to be
expensive, but still the tyrant fashion was inflexible
on the subject; so, to comply with her
rules, and let the chief have his properties with
him in the grave, miniature swords, &amp;c., were
made, and buried with him; just in the same way
as some of your ladies of fashion, though they
have killed their goose, will still keep it; in
other words, though their diamonds are in the
hands of the Jews, still love to glitter about in
paste.”</p>

<p>“Cunning people those old Vikings,” thought I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” continued our obliging informant, “and
look at these,” pointing to what looked like balls
of gold. “They are weights gilt all over. The
reason why they were gilt was the more easily to
detect any loss of weight, which a dishonest
merchant, had discovery not been certain, might
otherwise have contrived to inflict on them.”
Those mighty wind-instruments, six feet long, are
the war-horns (Luren) of the bronze period; under
these coats of mail throbbed the bosoms of some
valorous freebooters handed down to fame by
Snorro. “Look here,” continued he, “these pieces
of thick gold and silver wire were used for money
in the same way as later the links of a chain
were used for that purpose. Here is a curious
gold medal of Constantine, most likely used as a
military decoration. The reverse has no impress
on it.” This reminded me of the buttons and
other ornaments in Thelemarken, which are exact
copies of fashions in use hundreds of years ago.
Here again are some Bezants, coins minted at Byzantium,
which were either brought over by the
ships of the Vikings, or were carried up the Volga to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Novgorod, a place founded by the Northmen, and
so on to Scandinavia, by the merchants and
mercenary soldiers who in early times flocked to
the East. Gotland used to be a gathering-place
for those who thus passed to and fro, and to this
Wisby owes its former greatness. Many of
these articles of value were probably buried
by the owner on setting out upon some fresh
expedition from which he never returned, and
their discovery has been due to the plough or the
spade, while others have been unearthed from
the barrows and cromlechs. Here, again, are some
primstavs, or old Scandinavian wooden calendars.
You see they are of two sorts&mdash;one straight, like the
one I picked up in Thelemarken, while another is
in the shape of an elongated ellipse. If you
compare them, you will now find how much they
differed, not only in shape, but also in the signs
made to betoken the different days in the calendar.
“You have heard of our Queen Dagmar. Here is
a beautiful enamelled cross of Byzantine workmanship
which she once wore around her neck. You
have travelled in Norway? Wait a moment,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
continued the voluble Professor, as he directed
an attendant to open a massive escritoir. “You
are aware, sir, that it is the custom in Norway
and Sweden for brides to wear a crown. I
thought that, before the old custom died, I would
secure a memento of it. I had very great difficulty,
the peasants were so loth to part with
them, but at last I succeeded, and behold the
result, sir. That crown is from Iceland, that
from Sweden, and that from Norway. It is three
hundred years old. That fact I have on the best
authority. It used to be lent out far and near for
a fixed sum, and, computing the weddings it attended
at one hundred per annum, which is very
moderate, it must have encircled the heads of
thirty thousand brides on their wedding-day.
Very curious, Excellence!” he continued, giving
the Russian grandee a sly poke in the ribs.</p>

<p>The idea seemed to amuse the old gentleman
of the stars and green velvet collar wonderfully.</p>

<p>“Sapperlot! Potztannsend noch ein mal!” he
ejaculated, with great animation, while the antiquarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
dust seemed to roll from his eyes, and
they gleamed up uncommonly.</p>

<p>In the same case I observed more than one hundred
Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian spoons of
quaint shape, though they were nearly all of what
we call the Apostle type.</p>

<p>But we must take leave of the museum with
the remark that, to see it thoroughly, would
require a great many visits. To an Englishman,
whose country was so long intimately connected
with Scandinavia,&mdash;and which has most likely
undergone pretty nearly the same vicissitudes of
civilization and occupancy as Scandinavia itself&mdash;this
collection must be intensely interesting,
especially when examined by the light thrown
upon it by Worsaae and others.</p>

<p>Indeed, if England wishes to know the facts of
her Scandinavian period, it is to these people that
she must look for information.</p>

<p>“Ten per cent. for my money!” That, alas!
is too often an Englishman’s motto now-a-days;
“and I can’t get that by troubling my head about
King Olaf or Canute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>While I write this I am reminded of an agreeable,
good-looking young Briton whom I met here; he is a
physician making four thousand a-year by administering
doses of soft sawder. Thrown by circumstances
early on the world, he has not had the
opportunity of acquiring ideas or knowledge out of
the treadmill of his profession. He is just fresh
from Norway, through which he has shot like a
rocket, being pressed for time.</p>

<p>“How beautiful the rivers are there,” he observed;
“so rapid. By-the-bye, though, your river
at Oxford must be something like them. The
poet says, ‘Isis rolling rapidly!’”</p>

<p>Leaving the museum, I dined at the great
restaurant’s of Copenhagen, Jomfru Henkel’s, in the
Ostergade; it was too crowded for comfort. Dinner
is <i>à la carte</i>.</p>

<p>Some convicts were mending the roadway in one
of the streets; their jackets were half black, half
yellow, trousers ditto, only that where the jacket was
black, the inexpressibles were yellow on the same
side, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Their legs were heavily
chained. Many carriages were assembled round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the church of the Holy Ghost; I found it was a
wedding. All European nations, I believe, but
the English, choose the afternoon for the ceremony.</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen’s colossal statues in white marble of
our Saviour and his Apostles which adorn the
Frue Kirke, are too well known to need description.</p>

<p>At the Christianborg, or Palace of King Christian,
the lions that caught my attention first were
the three literal ones in massive silver, which
always figure at the enthronization of the Danish
monarchs. Next to them I observed the metaphorical
lions, viz., the sword of Gustavus Adolphus,
the cup in which Peter the Great used to
take his matutinal dram, the portrait of the unhappy
Matilda, and of the wretched Christian VII.</p>

<p>Blush Oxford and Cambridge, when you know
that on the walls of this palace, side by side with
the freedom of the City of London and the Goldsmiths’
Company (but the London citizens are of
course not very particular in these matters), hang
your diplomas of D.C.L., engrossed on white satin,
conferred upon this precious specimen of a husband
and king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening I went to see a comedy of Holberg’s
at the theatre, <i>Jacob von Tybö</i> by name.
It seemed to create immense fun, which was not to
be wondered at, for the piece contained a rap at the
German customs, and braggadocio style of that
people in vogue here some hundred years ago.
The taste for that sort of thing, as may readily be
imagined, no longer exists here. Roars of laughter
accompanied every hit at Tuskland. The two
Roskilds and Madame Pfister acquitted themselves
well. The temperature of the building was as
nearly as possible that of the Black Hole of Calcutta,
as far as I was able to judge by my own
feelings compared with the historical account of
that delectable place. A lady next me told me
that they had long talked of an improved building.</p>

<p>Next day I visited the Seamen’s Burial Ground,
where, clustering about an elevated mound, are the
graves of the Danish sailors who fell in 1807. I
observed an inscription in marble overgrown with
ivy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Kranz som Fadrelandet gav,</div>
<div class="verse">Den visner ei paa falden Krieger’s Grav.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The chaplet which their fatherland once gave</div>
<div class="verse">Shall never fade on fallen warrior’s grave.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>True to the motto, the monuments are decked
every Saturday with fresh flowers. Fuchsias were
also growing in great numbers about. The different
spaces of ground are let for a hundred years;
if the lease is not renewed then, I presume the
Company will enter upon the premises. There
were traces about, I observed, of English whittlers.
Our countrymen seem to remember the command
of the augur to Tarquinius, “cut boldly,” and
the King cut through.</p>

</div>

<p>The name of the steamer which took me past the
celebrated Three Crowns Battery, and along to
the pretty low shores of Zealand to Elsineur
(Helsingör), was the <i>Ophelia</i>, fare three marks.
In the Marielyst Gardens, which overhang the
famed Castle of Kronborg, is a Mordan’s-pencil-case-shaped
pillar of dirty granite, miscalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“Hamlet’s grave.” Yankees often resort here,
and pluck leaves from the lime-trees overhanging
the mausoleum, for the purpose of conveyance to
their own country.</p>

<p>But this is not the only point of interest for
Brother Jonathan. Look at the Sound yonder,
refulgent in the light of the evening sun, with the
numberless vessels brought up for the night,
having been warned by the bristling cannon
to stop, and pay toll. I don’t wonder that those
scheming, go-ahead people, object to the institution
altogether&mdash;albeit the proceeds are a vital
question for Denmark. On the steamer, I fell
into conversation with a Danish pilot about this
matter. I found that he, like others of his
countrymen, was very slow to acknowledge that
ships are forced to stop opposite the castle. He
said that only ships bound to Russia do so,
because the Czar insists on their having their
papers <i>viséd</i> by the Danish authorities before
they are permitted to enter his ports.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Finding there was no public conveyance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Fredericksborg, which I purposed visiting, I must
fain hire a one-horse vehicle at the Post. It was
a sort of mail phaeton, of the most cumbrous and
unwieldy description&mdash;I don’t know how much
dearer than in Norway&mdash;so slow, too. On the
road we pass the romantic lake of Gurre, the
scene of King Valdemar’s nightly hunt. Some
storks remind the traveller of Holland. Right
glad I was when we at length jogged over divers
drawbridges spanning very green moats, and
through sundry gates, and emerged upon a large
square, facing the main entrance to the castle.</p>

<p>The private apartments, I found, were, by a
recent regulation, invisible, as his Majesty has
taken to living a good deal here. But I was
shown the chapel, in which all the monarchs of
Denmark are crowned, gorgeous with silver, ebony,
and ivory; and the Riddersaal over it, one hundred
and sixty feet long, with its elaborate ceiling, and
many portraits: and, marvellous to relate, the
custodian would have nothing for his trouble but
thanks. In the stable were several little Iceland
ponies, which looked like a cross between the
Norsk and Shetland races. They were fat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sleek, and, no doubt, have an easy time of it;
indeed, Denmark is a sort of equine paradise.
What well-to-do fellows those four strapping
brown horses were that somnambulized with the
diligence that conveyed us to Copenhagen. That
their slumbrous equanimity might not be disturbed,
the very traces were padded, and, instead
of collars, they wore broad soft chest-straps. The
driver told me they cost three hundred and fifty
dollars each. That flat road, passing through
numerous beech-woods was four and a-half Danish
miles long, equal to twenty English, and took us
more than four hours to accomplish.</p>

<p>Bidding adieu to Copenhagen, I returned by
rail to Korsör, and embarked in the night-boat
<i>Skirner</i>, from thence to Kiel. As the name of
the vessel, like almost every one in Scandinavia, is
drawn from the old Northern mythology, I shall
borrow from the same source for an emblem of the
stifling state of the atmosphere in the cabin.
“A regular Muspelheim!” said I to a Dane, as I
pantingly look round before turning in, and saw
every vent closed. A fog retarded our progress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it was not till late the next afternoon that I found
myself in Hamburg. Some few hours later I was
under the roof of mine host of the “Three Crowns,”
at Düsseldorf, where I purposed paying a visit to
Tidemann, the Norwegian painter. Unfortunately,
he was not returned from his summer travels, so
that I could not deliver to him the greeting I had
brought him from his friends in the Far North. His
most recent work, which I had heard much of, the
“Wounded Bear-hunter returning Home, having
bagged his prey,” was also away, having been purchased
by the King of Sweden. At the Institute,
however, I saw several sketches and paintings by
this master.</p>

<p>Anna Gulsvig is evidently the original of the
“Grandmother telling Stories.”</p>

<p>Bagge’s “Landscape in Valders,” and Nordenberg’s
“Dalecarlian Scenes,” brought back for a
moment the land I had quitted to my mind and
vision. “The Mother teaching her Children,” and
“The Boiling of the Porridge,” also by Tidemann,
proclaim him to be the Teniers of Norway. Though
while he catches the national traits, he manages to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
represent them without vulgarity. But perhaps
this lies in the nature of the thing. The heavy-built
Dutchman anchored on his square flat island
of mud can’t possibly have any of that rugged elevation
of mind, or romance of sentiment, that
would belong to the child of the mountain and
lake.</p>

<p>The school of Düsseldorf&mdash;if such it can be
called&mdash;has turned out some great artists, <i>e.g.</i>,
Kaulbach and Cornelius; but the place has never
been itself since it lost its magnificent collection
of pictures, which now grace the Pinacothek at
Munich.</p>

<p>As I sipped a cup of coffee in the evening, I
read a most grandiloquent account of the prospects
of the Düsseldorf Theatre for the ensuing
winter. The first lover was perfection, while the
tragedy queen was “unübertrefflich” (not to be
surpassed). The part of tender mother and
matron was also about to be taken by a lady of
no mean theatrical pretensions. This self-complacency
of the inhabitants of the smaller cities
is quite delightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>On board the steamer to Emmerich was a family
of French Jews, busily engaged, not in looking
about them, but in calculating their expenses,
though dressed in the pink of fashion.</p>

<p>Here I am at Amsterdam. In the Grand Place
is a monument in memory of Dutch bravery and
obstinacy evinced in the fight with Belgium. This
has only just been erected, with great fêtes and
rejoicings. Well, to be sure! this reminds me of
the Munich obelisk, in memory of those luckless
thirty thousand Bavarians who swelled Napoleon’s
expedition to Russia, and died in the cause
of his insatiable ambition. “Auch sie starben
für das Vaterland” is the motto.</p>

<p>V. Ruyter and V. Speke are both monumented
in the adjoining church. The former, who died at
Syracuse from a wound, is described in the inscription
as “Immensi tremor Oceani,” and owing all
to God, “et virtuti suæ.”</p>

<p>The warlike spirit of Young Amsterdam seems to
be effectually excited just now. As I passed through
the Exchange at a quarter to five <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, the merchants
were gone, and in their room was an obstreperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
crowd of <i>gamins</i>, armed “with sword and
pistol,” like Billy Taylor’s true love (only they
were sham), and thumping their drums, and the
drums thumping the roof, and the roof and the
drum together reverberating against the drum of
my ear till I was fairly stunned. “Where are the
police?” thought I, escaping from the hubbub
with feelings akin to what must have been those
of Hogarth’s enraged musician, or of a modern
London householder, fond of quiet, with the
Italian organ-grinders rending the air of his street.
Dutch is German in the Somersetshire dialect; so
I managed to comprehend, without much difficulty,
the short instructions of the passers-by as to my
route to various objects of interest. By-the-bye,
here is the house of Admiral de Ruyter, next to
the Norwegian Consulate. Over the door I see
there is his bust in stone.</p>

<p>As I pass along the canals, it puzzles me to
think how the Dutchman can live by, nay, revel
in the proximity of these seething tanks of beastliness
and corruption. That notion about the pernicious
effects of inhaling sewage effluvia must be
a myth, after all, and the sanitary commission a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
regular job. Indeed, I always thought so, after a
conversation I once had with a fellow in London,
the very picture of rude health, who told me he
got his living by mudlarking and catching rats in
the sewers, for which there was always a brisk demand
at Oxford and Cambridge, in term time.
Look at these jolly Amsterdamers. I verily believe
it would be the death of them if you separated
them from their stinking canals, or transported
them to some airy situation, with a turbulent river
hurrying past. Custom is second nature, and that
has doubtless much to do with it: but the nature
of the liquids poured down the inner man perhaps
fortifies Mynheer against the evil effects of the semi-solid
liquid of the canals. Just after breakfast I
went into the shop of the celebrated Wijnand Fockink,
the Justerini and Brooks of Amsterdam, to
purchase a case of liqueurs, when I heard a squabby-shaped
Dutchman ask for a glass of half-and-half.
It is astonishing, I thought with myself, how English
tastes and habits are gaining ground everywhere.
Of course he means porter and ale mixed.
The attendant supplied him with the article he
wanted, and it was bolted at a gulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Dutch half-and-half, reader, is a dram of raw
gin and curaçoa, in equal portions.</p>

<p>What a crowd of people, to be sure. “Holland
is over-peopled,” said a tradesman to me. “Why,
sir, you can have a good clerk for 20<i>l.</i> per annum.
The land is ready to stifle with the close packing.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “so it appears. That operation
going on under the bridge is a fit emblem of the
tightness of your population.”</p>

<p>As I spoke, I pointed to a man, or rather several
men, engaged in a national occupation: packing
herrings in barrels. How closely they were fitted,
rammed and crammed, and then a top was put on
the receptacle, and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>We are now in the Jewish quarter. “Our
people,” as the Israelites are wont to call themselves,
formerly looked on Amsterdam as a kind of
New Jerusalem. Indeed, they are a very important
and numerous part of the population. The
usual amount of dirt and finery, young lustrous
eyes, and old dingy clothes, black beards and red
beards, small infants and big hook noses, are jumbled
about the shop-doors and in the crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
thoroughfares. Here are some fair peasant girls,
Frieslanders, I should think, or from beyond the Y,
judging by their helmet-shaped head-dresses of gold
and silver plates, with the little fringe of lace drawn
across the forehead, just over the eyebrows, the
very same that Gerard Dow and Teniers have
placed before us. If they were not Dutch women,
and belonged to a very wide-awake race, I should
tremble for them, as they go staring and sauntering
about in rustic simplicity, for fear of that lynx-eyed
Fagan with the Satyr nose and leering eye fastened
upon them, who is clearly just the man to help to
despoil them of their gold and silver, or something
more precious still, in the way of his trade.</p>

<p>As we walk through the streets, the chimes, that
ever and anon ring out from the old belfries,
remind us that we are in the Low Countries; and
if that were not sufficient, the showers of water on
this bright sunny day descending from the house-sides,
after being syringed against them by some
industrious abigail, make the fact disagreeably
apparent to the passer-by. This will prepare me
for my visit to Broek; not that there is so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to be seen there&mdash;and Albert Smith has brought the
place bodily before us&mdash;but if one left it out, all
one’s friends that had been there would aver, with the
greatest possible emphasis and solemnity, that I
had omitted seeing <i>the</i> wonder of Holland. So
I shall <i>do</i> it, if all be well.</p>

<p>Here is the Trippenhuus, or Museum of Dutch
paintings, situated, of course, on a canal. Van der
Helst’s picture of the “Burgher Guard met to celebrate
the Treaty of Münster”&mdash;the Magna Charta
of Dutch independence, pronounced by Sir Joshua
to be the finest of its kind in the world&mdash;of course
claims my first attention. The three fingers held
up, emblematic of the Trinity, is the continental
equivalent to the English taking Testament in hand
upon swearing an oath. But as everybody that
has visited Amsterdam knows all about this picture,
and those two of Rembrandt’s, the “Night-watch,”
and that other of the “Guild of Cloth
Merchants,” this mention of them will suffice.</p>

<p>That picture is Jan Steen’s “Fête of St. Nicholas,”
a national festival in Holland. The saint is
supposed to come down the chimney, and shower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
bonbons on the good children, while he does not
forget to bring a rod for the naughty child’s
back.</p>

<p>De Ruyter is also here, with his flashing eye,
contracted brow, and dark hair. While, of course,
the collection is not devoid of some of Vandervelde’s
pictures of Holland’s naval victories when
Holland was a great nation.</p>

<p>There must have been great genius and great
wealth in this country wherewith to reward it, in the
seventeenth century. In this very town were born
Van Dyk, Van Huysum, and Du Jardin; in Leyden,
G. Douw, Metzu, W. Mieris, Rembrandt, and J.
Steen. Utrecht had its Bol and Hondekoeter;
while Haarlem, which was never more than a provincial
town with 48,000 inhabitants, produced a
Berghem, a Hugtenberg, a Ruysdael, a Van der
Helst, and a Wouvermans.</p>

<p>In proof of the <i>sharpness</i> of the Amsterdamers,
I may mention that most of the diamonds of
Europe are cut here.</p>

<p>Next day, I took the steamer to Zaandam, metamorphosed
by us into Saardam, pretty much on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
same principle, I suppose, that an English beefsteak
becomes in the mouths of the French a “biftek.”
The tumble-down board-house, with red tile
roof, built by the semi-savage Peter, in 1632, will
last all the longer for having been put in a brick-case
by one of the imperial Russian family. I
always look on Peter’s shipwright adventures, under
the name of Master Baas, as a great exaggeration.
He perhaps wanted to make his subjects take up
the art, but he never had any serious thoughts of
carpentering himself. He only was here three days,
and, as the veracious old lady who showed the place
told me, he built this house himself, so what time
had he for the dockyards? When some of your great
folks go to the Foundling Hospital, and eat the
plum-pudding on Christmas-day, or visit Woolwich
and taste the dietary, and seem to like it very
much, that is just such another make-believe.</p>

<p>“Nothing is too little for a great man,” was the
inscription on the marble slab over the chimney-piece,
placed there by the very hand of Alexander I.
of Russia. In the room are two cupboards, in one
of which Peter kept his victuals, while the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was his dormitory. If Peter slept in that cupboard,
and if he shut the door of it, all I have to say is,
the ventilation must have been very deficient, and
how he ever survived it is a wonder. The whole
hut is comprised in two rooms. In the other room
are two pictures of the Czar. In the one, presented
in ’56 by Prince Demidoff, the Czar, while
at work, axe in hand, is supposed to have received
unwelcome intelligence from Muscovy, and is dictating
a dispatch to his secretary. The finely
chiselled features, pale complexion, and air of refinement,
here fathered on this ruffian, never belonged
to him. The other picture, presented by
the munificent and patriotic M. Van der Hoof, is
infinitely more to the purpose, and shows you the
man as he really was, and in short, as he appears
in a contemporary portrait at the Rosenborg Slot.
Thick, sensual lips&mdash;the very lips to give an unchaste
kiss, or suck up strong waters&mdash;contracted
brow, bushy eyebrows, coarse, dark hair and moustache&mdash;that
is the real man. He wears broad loose
breeches reaching to the knee, and on the table is
a glass of grog to refresh him at his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes sufficed for me to take the whole
thing in, and to get back in time for the returning
steamer, otherwise I should have been stranded on
this mud island for some hours, and there is nought
else to see but a picture in the church of the terrible
inundation; the ship-building days of Zaandam
having long since gone by, and passed to other
places.</p>

<p>By this economy of time I shall be enabled to
take the afternoon treckshuit to Broek. A ferry-boat
carries us over the Y from Amsterdam, a distance
of two or three hundred yards, to Buiksloot,
the starting-place of the treckshuit, when, to my
surprise, each passenger gives an extra gratuity to
the boatman. This shows to what lengths the fee-system
may go. And yet Englishmen persist in
introducing it into Norway, where hitherto it has
been unknown. Entering into the little den called
cabin, I settled down and looked around me. On
the table were the Lares, to wit, a brass candlestick,
beyond it a brass stand about a foot high, with a
pair of snuffers on it, and then two brasiers containing
charcoal, the whole shining wonderfully
bright. Opposite me, sitting on the puffy cushions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was a substantial-looking peasant, immensely
stout and broad sterned, dressed in a dark
jacket and very wide velveteen trousers. He
wore a large gold seal, about the size and
shape of a half-pound packet of moist sugar,
and a double gold brooch, connected by a chain.
As the boat seemed a long time in starting, I
emerged again from this odd little shop to ascertain
the cause of the delay, when I found to my surprise
that we were already under way. So noiselessly
was the operation effected, that I was not
aware of it. Dragged by a horse, on which sat a
sleepy lad, singing a sleepy song, the boat glided
mutely along. The only sound beside the drone
of the boy was the rustling of the reeds, which
seemed to whisper, “What an ass you are for
coming along this route. You, who have just
come from the land of the mountain and the flood,
to paddle about among these frogs.” Really, the
whole affair is desperately slow, and there is nothing
in the world to see but numerous windmills, with
their thatched roof and sides, whose labour it is to
drain the large green meadows lying some feet below
us, on which numerous herds of cows are feeding.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Broek&mdash;A Dutchman’s idea of Paradise&mdash;A toy-house for

Bull abroad&mdash;All the fun of the fair&mdash;A popular

</div>

<p>I was not sorry when the captain, who of course
received a fee for himself besides the fare, called out
“Broek!” The stagnation of water, and sound,
and life in general, on a Dutch canal, is positively
oppressive to the feelings; it would have been
quite a relief to have had a little shindy among the
passengers and the crew, such as gave a variety to
the canal voyage of Horace to Brundusium.</p>

<p>To enliven matters, supposing we tell you a tale
about Broek, which I of course ferreted out
of a drowsy Dutch chronicle, but which the
ill-natured Smelfungus says has been already
told by Washington Irvine. In former times, the
people of the place were sadly negligent of
their spiritual duties, and turned a very deaf ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to the exhortations of the clergyman. A new
parson at last arrived, who beholding all the people
given to idolatry in the shape of washing, washing,
washing all the day long, and apparently thinking
of nothing else, hit upon a new scheme for reforming
them. He bid them be righteous and fear God,
and then they should get to Paradise, and he described
what joys should be theirs in that abode
of bliss. This was the old tale, and the congregation
were on the point of subsiding into their usual
sleep.</p>

<p>“The abode of bliss,” continued the preacher,
“and cleanliness, and everlasting washing.” The
Dutchmen opened their eyes. “Yes,” proceeded
the preacher; “the joys of earth shall to the good
be continued in heaven. You will be occupied in
washing, and scrubbing, and cleaning, and in
cleaning, and washing, and scrubbing, for ever and
ever, amen.”</p>

<p>He had hit the right chord; the parson became
popular, the church filled, and a great reformation
was wrought in Broek.</p>

<p>Sauntering along the Grand Canal, from which,
as from a backbone, ribbed out divers lesser canals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I entered, at the bidding of an old lady, one of the
houses of the place, with the date of 1612 over it.
Of course its floor was swept and garnished, and
the little pan of lighted turf was burning in the
fireplace; and there was the usual amount of
china vases, and knickknacks of all descriptions scattered
about to make up a show. And then she
showed me the bed like a berth, which smelt very
fusty, and the door, which is never opened except
at a burial or bridal. After this, I walked into a
little warehouse adjoining, all painted and prim, and
saw eight thousand cannon-ball-shaped cheeses in
a row, value one dollar a piece, each with a red
skin, like a very young infant’s. This colour is
obtained, I understand, by immersing them in a
decoction of Bordeaux grape husks, which are imported
from France for the purpose. I next went
to the bridge over the canal, and tried to sketch
the avenue of dwarf-like trees and the row of toy-houses,
and the old man brushing away two or
three leaves that had fallen on the sward. At this
moment came by a buxom girl in the genuine
costume of the place, who exclaimed, “Lauk, he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sketching!” (in Dutch) and stood immovable
before me, and so of course I proceeded incontinently
to sketch her in the foreground, she
keeping quite still, and then coming and peeping
over my shoulder, to see how she looked on
paper.</p>

<p>Finding it was late, I hurried back to catch the
return boat, faster, I should think, than anybody
ever ventured before to go in Broek; at least, I
judged so from the looks of sleepy astonishment
and almost displeasure which seemed to gather on
the Lotos-eater-like countenances of the citizens I
met. As it was, I just saved the boat, and am
now again gliding smoothly back to Amsterdam.</p>

<p>As I look through the windows of the cabin, I
perceive a few golden plover and stints basking
listlessly among the reeds, undisturbed by our
transit. This time, however, there was more bustle
on board. There were two foreigners who were
very full of talk, and who, though they were speaking
to a Dutchman in French, I knew at once to
be English. As I finished up my sketch, I heard
one of these gentlemen say, “Ah! I am an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Englishman; you would not have thought it, but
so it is. Few English speak French with a correct
accent, but I, maw (moi?); jabbeta seese ann
ong France, solemong pour parlay lar lang, ay
maw jay parl parfaitmong biong.” I differed from
him. It has seldom been my lot to hear French
spoken worse. John Bull abroad is certainly a
curiosity.</p>

<p>That evening I sallied out to see the Kirmess,
or great annual fair. Its chief scene was round
the statue of Rembrandt, in the heart of the city.
Hogarth’s “Southwark Fair” would give but a
faint idea of the state of things. There was the
usual amount of wild beasts and giants; there was
a pumpkin of a woman and her own brother, as thin
as if he were training to get up the inside of a gas-pipe,
to be seen inside one show, and their faithful
portraits outside on a canvas, painted after the
school of Sir Peter Paul Rubens. A mechanical
theatre from Bamberg was apparently doing an
immense trade under the auspices of an unmistakable
Jewish family, who appeared from time to time
on the platform. Close by was a picture of Sebastopol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which professed to have arrived from London.
But the undiscerning public seemed to care very
little about it; it was in vain that they were summoned
to advance to the ticket-office by the sound
of fife and drum&mdash;one could almost imagine, that
the person of rueful and despairing aspect who was
waiting for the people to ascend the parapet, had
been spending some weeks in the trenches before
the devoted city. The crowds, that surged about
in serried masses, had their wants well seen to in
the refreshment way. One favourite esculent was
brown smoked eels, weighing perhaps half a pound
each, and placed in large heaps on neat-looking
stalls, kept by neat-looking people. The eels were
stretched out full length as stiff as pokers, and I
saw several respectable looking sight-seers solacing
themselves with a fish of the sort.</p>

<p>But the most popular refreshment remains to
be mentioned. Ranged along the street, in a
compact row, were a number of gaudily painted
temples; in front of each sat the priestess.
Mostly, she was young and pretty, but here and
there, blowsy and obese. By her side was a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
bright copper caldron, steaming with a white
hasty-pudding-looking substance. In front of her
was a fire, over which was a broad square plate of
iron, studded with small holes like a bagatelle-board.
The female held in her hand a wand, or
rather a long iron spoon, which she dabbed into
the caldron, and then delivered a portion of the
contents into the little holes above-mentioned.
This required great adroitness; but custom appeared
to have brought her to the pinnacle of her
art, and she hardly ever missed her mark. In a
second or two, the hasty-pudding became transformed
into a sort of small pancake, and was
whipped out of its <i>locus in quo</i> by a light-fingered
acolyte of the male sex. I observed that behind
the priestess were sundry little alcoves, shaded by
bright-coloured curtains; in these might be seen
loving pairs, feasting on the handiworks of the
lady of the spoon. The repast was simple, and
was soon dispatched, for a constant succession of
votaries kept entering and issuing from the alcoves.
If I was correctly informed, it would have been
possible to have got as high as the top button<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of your waistcoat for the small sum of a few
stivers.</p>

<p>I was sorry to hear that this national festival&mdash;a
sort of Dutch carnival, which is visited by all
classes&mdash;is ruinous to what is left of morals in
Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Before leaving the city, I must not omit to
mention the Zoological Gardens. If you wish to
find them, you must ask for the “Artis;” that
is the name it is known by to every gamin and
fisherman in Amsterdam. The Dutch are very
classical, and the inscription over the entrance is,
“Naturæ artis magistra.” Half-a-dozen other
public places go by Latin names. Thus, the
Royal Institution of Literature and Art is called
“Felix Meritis,” from the first words of a legend
on the front of the building.</p>

<p>Next day, I take leave of my room in the hotel,
with its odd French-shaped beds, closed in by
heavy green stuff curtains, and great projecting
chimney-piece. In my bill, the charge for bed
tacitly includes that for breakfast; these two items
being, seemingly, considered by the Dutch all one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thing. Cheese appears to be invariably eaten by
the natives with their morning coffee, which is kept
hot by a little spirit-lamp under the coffee-pot.</p>

<p>After this, I stopped at Shravenhagen (the
Hague), to see Paul Potter’s Bull. On the
Sunday, attended a Calvinistic place of worship,
where I was horrified to behold the irreverent way
in which the male part of the congregation,
who looked not unlike your unpleasant political
dissenter at a church-rate meeting, gossiped with
their hats on their heads until the entrance of the
clergyman.</p>

<p>Next day, I found myself at Rotterdam. The
steamer for London managed, near Helvoetsluys,
to break the floats of her paddle-wheel; the
engine could not be worked; and as there was a
heavy sea and strong wind blowing on-shore, we
should soon have been there, had not another
steamer come to our assistance, and towed us
back into a place of safety. After repairing
damages, we proceeded on our voyage, and eventually
arrived unharmed in London.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my rooms, about the end of the
month of July, 1857, having been dragged perforce,
by various necessary avocations, into the solitude of
the Oxford Long Vacation; not a soul in this college,
or, in short, in any college. “A decided case of ‘Last
Rose of Summer,’” mused I. “Those rats or mice,
too, in the cupboard, what a clattering and squeaking
they keep up, lamenting, probably, the death
of one of their companions in the trap this morning;
but, nevertheless, they are not a bit intimidated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for it is hunger that makes them valiant.”
The proverb, “Hungry as a church mouse,” fits a
college mouse in Long Vacation exactly. The
supplies are entirely stopped with the departure of
the men: no remnants of cold chicken, or bread-and-butter,
no candles. It is not surprising, then,
they have all found me out.</p>

<p>I positively go to bed in fear and trembling,
lest they should make a nocturnal attack.</p>

<p class="noindent">The fate of that worthy Bishop Hatto stares me
in the face. If they did not spare so exalted a personage,
what will become of me? And as for keeping

They are a treacherous race, and purr, and
fawn, and play the villain&mdash;quadrupedal Nena
Sahibs. I always hated them, and still more so
since an incident I witnessed one year in Norway.</p>

<p>On the newly-mown grass before the cottage
where I was staying, a lot of little redpoles&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sparrows of those high latitudes&mdash;were very busily
engaged picking up their honest livelihood, and
making cheerful remarks to one another on the
brightness of the weather and the flavour of the hay-seeds.
Intently examining their motions through
my glass, I had paid no heed to a cat which seemed
rolling about carelessly on the lawn. Suddenly,
I perceived that it had imperceptibly edged nearer
and nearer to the pretty little birds, and was
gliding, snake-like, towards them. I tapped at
the window lustily, and screamed out in hopes of
alarming my friends; but it was too late; they
flew up, the cat sprung up aloft likewise, caught
a poor little fellow in mid-air, and was away with
it and out of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>Norway! and why am I not there? It is too late
this year to think of it. I must write to that friend,
and say I can’t keep my promise, and join him
thither. No, I must be content with a little trout-fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in Wales or Scotland. At this moment a tap
is heard at the door. An ingenuous youth, undergraduate
of St. Sapientia College, and resident in
the neighbourhood, had brought a letter of introduction
from a common friend, begging me, as one deep
in the mysteries of Norwegian travelling, to give the
bearer some information respecting that country, as
he thought of taking a month’s trip thither.</p>

<p>As I pulled out Munck’s map, chalked out a
route for the youth, and gave him a little practical
advice on the subject, a regular spasm came across
me. Iö was never plagued by that malicious gadfly,
or “tsetse,” so much as I was for the rest of the day
by an irresistible desire to be off to the old country.
The steamer was to start in three days. On the
third day I stood on board of her, in the highest
possible spirits. The ingenuous youth was also
there; but high hope was not the expression on
his countenance. Most wofully he approached
me. To make assurance doubly sure, and secure
a good berth, he had left home the day before.
On arriving at the terminus, his box was not to
be found&mdash;the box with all his traps, and the 50<i>l.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in it. He had sent telegrams, or telegraphemes,
to the four ends of Great Britain for the missing
box; but it was not forthcoming. In a few hours
we weighed anchor. The expectant visitor was
left behind, and as there was no vessel to Norway
for the next fortnight, the chances were that his
trip thither would not take place. The above
facts will serve as a warning to young travellers.</p>

<p>As daylight peered through the small porthole in
the morning, I found that we had no less than eight
people in our cabin, and that the porthole was
shut, although it was smooth water.</p>

<p>“What an atmosphere,” said an Englishman, in
an adjoining berth. “I have opened that porthole
two or three times in the night; but that fat,
drum-bellied Norwegian there, who seems as fond
of hot, stifling air as a melon, has shut it
again.”</p>

<p>“What can you expect of the people of a
country,” replied I, “where the windows are often
not made to open?”</p>

<p>A tall, gentlemanly-looking man, who stood
before the looking-glass, and had just brushed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
glossy wig into a peak like Mr. Pecksniff, here
turned round and said, in Norwegian-English&mdash;</p>

<p>“I do assure you, sir, that the Norwegian windows
will open.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the towns; but frequently in the
country not. I have been there a good deal, and
I speak from experience.”</p>

<p>I find that our friend, who is very communicative,
was in London in the days of the Prince
Regent&mdash;yes, and he once dined with him at the
London Tavern, at a dinner given in aid of
foreigners in distress: the ticket cost 10<i>l.</i> He remembers
perfectly well how, on another occasion,
a tortoise-shell, all alive, was carried round London
in a cart, with a notice that it would be made into
<i>tortoise-shell</i> soup on a certain day. He dined,
and the soup was super-excellent.</p>

<p>Consul &mdash;&mdash;, for I found that he had attained that
distinction&mdash;was well acquainted with all the resorts
of London. Worxall pleased him much. He had
even learned to box. He had also something to
say about the war with the Swedes, led on by
Karl Johann, in which he took part.</p>

<p>After dinner we divert ourselves by observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the sleeping countenance of the obese Norwegian
who was so fond of carbonic acid gas, assume all
sorts of colours,&mdash;livid, red, yellow,&mdash;not from
repletion, though this might well have been the
case, but from the light of the painted glass
overhead, which transferred its chameleon hues
to his physiognomy.</p>

<p>Here I am, once more plunging into the heart
of Norway in the national vehicle, the carriole; up
hills, down hills, across stony morasses, through
sandy pine forests. We landed this afternoon at
Christiansand, and I am now seven miles north of it,
and standing by the side of the magnificent
Torrisdal river, waiting for the great unwieldy
ferry-boat to come over. The stream is strong
and broad, and there is only one man working the
craft; but, by taking advantage of a back stream
on the other side, and one on this, he has actually
accomplished the passage with little trouble, and
hit the landing-place to an inch.</p>

<p>On the other side, three or four carrioles, some
of them double ones, are just descending the
steep hill, and I have to wait till they get down to
the waterside, in consequence of the narrowness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the road. One of the strangers, with a broad gold
band round his cap, turns out to be the British
consul. He is returning with a party of ladies
and gentlemen from a pic-nic at the Vigelandsfoss,
about three miles from this, where the river makes
a fine fall.</p>

<p>That evening we stop at the Verwalter’s
(Bailiff’s), close by the falls. I have no salmon-rod,
but Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, an Englishman, who has
come up with me to sketch the foss, and try for a
salmon, obtains leave, as a great favour, to fish in
the pools for one dollar a day, and a dollar to each
of the boatmen. The solitary grilse that he succeeded
in catching during the next day cost him
therefore some fifteen shillings. The charges are
an infallible sign that Englishmen have been
here.</p>

<p>As in the Tweed, the take of salmon in these
southern rivers has fallen off terribly. In Mandal
river, a little to the westward, the fishing in the
last twenty years has become one-tenth of what it
was. Here, where 1600 fish used to be taken
yearly, 200 only are caught. But at Boen, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Topdal river, which, like this, enters the sea at
Christiansand, no decrease is observable. For the
last ten years the average yield of the salmon fishery
there has been 2733 fish per annum. In this state
of things, the services of Mr. Hetting, the person
deputed by the Norwegian Government to travel
about the country and teach the inhabitants the
method of artificially breeding salmon and other
fish, have been had recourse to. Near this,
breeding-places have been constructed under his
auspices.</p>

<p>Extensive saw-mills are erected all about this
place; and it is probable that the dust, which is
known to bother the salmon by clogging their
gills, may have diminished their productiveness,
or driven them elsewhere. The vast volume of
water which here descends, is cut into two distinct
falls; but a third fall, a few hundred yards above,
excels them in height and grandeur.</p>

<p>While eating my breakfast, an old dame comes
in with a large basket and mysterious looks. Her
mission is one of great importance&mdash;viz., to hire
the bridal crown belonging to the mistress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
house, for a wedding, which will take place at the
neighbouring church this afternoon. She gets
the article, and pays one dollar for the use of it.
Hearing that the bridal <i>cortège</i> will sweep by at
five o’clock, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, on its way from the church, I
determined to defer my journey northwards till it
had passed.</p>

<p>At that hour, the cry of “They come! they
come!” saluted my ears. Pencil or pen of
Teniers or Fielding, would that you were mine,
so that I might do justice to what I saw. Down
the steep hill leading to the house there came, at
a slow pace, first a carriole, with that important
functionary, the Kiögemester, standing on the
board behind, and, like a Hansom cabman, holding
the reins over the head of the bridesmaid, a fat
old lady, with a voluminous pile of white upon her
head, supposed to be a cap. Next came a cart,
containing two spruce young maidens, who wore
caps of dark check with broad strings of red satin
riband, in shape a cross between those worn by the
buy-a-broom girls and the present fashionable
bonnet, which does <i>not</i> cover the head of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ladies. Their jackets were of dark blue cloth, and
skirt of the same material and colour, with a narrow
scarlet edging, similar to that worn by peasant women
in parts of Wales. Over the jacket was a coloured
shawl, the ends crossed at the waist, and pinned
tight. Add to this a large pink apron, and in their
hands a white kerchief, after the manner of Scotch
girls, on their way to kirk. After these came a carriole,
with four little boys and girls clustered upon it.</p>

<p>But the climax is now reached. The next
vehicle, a cart, contains the chief actors in the
show, the bride and bridegroom, who are people
of slender means. He is evidently somewhat the
worse, or better, for liquor, and is dressed in the
short blue seaman’s jacket and trousers, which
have become common in Norway wherever the old
national costume has disappeared. The bride&mdash;oh!
all ye little loves, lave the point of my pen in
<i>couleur de rose</i>, that I may describe meetly this
mature votary of Venus. There she sat like an
image of the goddess Cybele; on her head a turret
of pasteboard, covered with red cloth, with flamboyant
mouldings of spangles, beads, and gold lace;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
miserable counterfeit of the fine old Norwegian
bridal crown of silver gilt! Nodding over the
turret was a plume of manifold feathers&mdash;ostrich,
peacock, chicken, mixed with artificial flowers;
from behind it streamed a cataract of ribands of
some fifteen different tints and patterns. Her
plain yellow physiognomy was unrelieved by a
single lock of hair.</p>

<p>“It is not the fashion,” explained a female
bystander, “for the bride to disclose any hair. It
must on this occasion be all tucked in out of sight.”</p>

<p>This ripe ogress of half a century was further
dressed in a red skirt with gold belt, a jacket of
black brocade, over which was a cuirass of
scarlet cloth shining resplendently in front with
the national ornament, the Sölje, a circular silver-gilt
brooch, three inches in diameter, with some
twenty gilded spoon-baits (fishermen will understand
me) hung on to its rim. Frippery of
divers sorts hung about her person. On each
shoulder was an epaulet or bunch of white gauze
bows, while the other ends of her arms were
adorned by ruffles and white gloves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>As this wonderful procession halted in front
of the door, the gallant Kiögemester advanced
and lifted the bride in his arms out of her vehicle.
As she mounted the door-steps, a decanter of
brandy in hand, all wreathed in smiles and
streamers, flowers and feathers, I bowed with
great reverence, which evidently gratified her
vanity.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what she reminds me of,” said
my English companion, who had left his profitless
fishing to see the sight, “a Tyrolese cow coming
home garlanded from the châlet. No doubt this
procession would look rather ridiculous in Hyde
Park, but here, in this wild outlandish country,
do you know, with the sombre pine-trees and the
grey rocks, and wild rushing river, it does not
strike me as so contemptible. She is tricked out
in all the finery she can lay her hands on, and in
that she is only doing the same as her sex
the world over, from the belle savage of Central
Africa to Queen Victoria herself.”</p>

<p>The Kiögemester (head cook)&mdash;not that he
attends to the cooking department, whatever he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
might have done in former days&mdash;is a very ancient
institution on this occasion. He is the soul
of the whole festival. Without him everything
would be in disorder or at a stand-still. Bowing
to the procession, he is also bowed down by the
weight of his responsibility. In his single self
he is supposed to combine, at first-rate weddings,
the offices of master of the ceremonies, chief
butler, speechifier, jester, precentor, and, above
all, of peace-maker. His activity as chief butler
often calls forth a corresponding degree of activity
as an assuager of broils. The baton which he
frequently wields is shaped like the ancient fool’s
bauble. If he is a proficient in his art he will,
like Mr. Robson, shine in the comic as well as the
serious department, alternating original jests with
solemn apophthegms. But the race is dying out.
The majority are mere second-hand performers.
The real adepts in the science give an <i>éclat</i> to
the whole proceedings, and are consequently much
in request, being sent for from long distances.</p>

<p>By-the-bye, I must not omit to mention that on
the left arm of the bride hung a red shawl, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
like that on the arm of the Spanish bull-fighter,
whose province it is to give the <i>coup de grace</i> to
the devoted bull. From the manner in which she
displayed it, I fancy it must have been an essential
item in her toilette. Hearing no pipe and tabor,
or, more strictly speaking, no fiddle, the almost
invariable accompaniment of these pageants, I
inquired the reason.</p>

<p>“They are gudfrygtig folk (God-fearing people);
they will have nothing to do with such vanities,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>There seemed to me, however, to be some contradiction
between this “God-fearing” scrupulosity
and the size of the bride’s person. It struck me,
as I saw the stalwart master of the ceremonies
exerting all his strength to lift her into the cart
again, that it was high time she was married.</p>

<p>At this moment up drives a gentleman dressed
in black, with dark rat-taily hair shading his
sallow complexion, and a very large nose bridged
by a huge pair of silver spectacles, the centre arch
of which was wrapped with black riband, that it
might not press too much on the keystone. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is the parson who has tied the fatal noose, and
is now wending his way homewards to his
secluded manse.</p>

<p>Bidding adieu to my companion, who purposed
driving round the coast, I now set off to the
station, Mosby, to join the main route to Sætersdal,
one of the wildest, poorest, and most primitive
valleys of Norway, which I’m bent on
exploring. On the road I once or twice narrowly
escape coming into collision with the carriole of
a young peasant who has been at the wedding.
Mad with brandy, he keeps passing and repassing
me at full gallop. The sagacious horse&mdash;I won’t
call him brute, a term much more applicable to
his master&mdash;makes up by his circumspection for
his driver’s want of it. He seems to be perfectly
aware of the state of things, and, while goaded
into a break-neck pace, dexterously avoids the
dangers.</p>

<p>Oak&mdash;a rare sight to me in this country&mdash;aspen
(asp), sycamore (lön), hazel, juniper, bracken, fringe
the sides of the road northward. Now and then
a group of white “wand-like” lilies (Tjorn-blom) rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from some silent tarn (in Old Norsk, Tjorn),
looking very small indeed after those huge fellows
I have left reposing in the arms of the Isis
at Oxford. Their moonlight-coloured chalice is
well-known to be a favourite haunt of the tiny
water-elves, so I suppose the Scandinavian ones
are tinier than their sisters of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Nor must I omit to mention the quantities of
Dutch myrtle, or sweet gale (pors), with which
the swampy grounds abound. It possesses strong
narcotic qualities, and is put in some districts into
the beer, while, elsewhere, a decoction of it is
sprinkled about the houses to intimidate the fleas,
who have a great horror of it. Lyng (lüng), some
of it white, and that of a peculiar kind, which I
have never seen before, also clings to the sides
of the high grounds, while strawberries and raspberries
of excellent taste are not wanting.</p>

</div>

<p>I stop for the night at the dreary station of
Homsmoen. By a singular economy in household
furniture, the cornice of the uncurtained
state-bed is made to serve as a shelf, and all the
crockery, together with the other household gods
or goods of the establishment, are perched thereon,
threatening to fall upon me if I made the
slightest movement, so that my feelings, and those
of Damocles, must have been not unlike; and
when I did get to sleep, my slumbers were suddenly
disturbed by the creeping of a mouse or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
rat, not “behind the arras,” for the wooden walls
were bare, but under my pillow. Gracious goodness!
is it my destiny then to fall a prey to these
wretches? Notwithstanding, I soon dozed off to
sleep again, muttering to myself something about
“Coctilibus muris,” and “dead for a ducat.”</p>

<p>In the morning, when the peasant-wife brings
me coffee, I tell her of the muscipular disturbances
of the past night. She replies, with much
<i>sang froid</i>, “O ja, de pleie at holde sig da” (Oh
yes, they are in the habit of being there), <i>i.e.</i>, in
the loose bed-straw.</p>

<p>While sipping my coffee, I read a printed address
hung upon the wall, wherein “a simple
Norwegian, of humble estate,” urges his countrymen
not to drink brandy. A second notice is an
explanation of infant baptism. This is evidently
to counteract the doctrines of the clergyman
Lammers, who, as I have mentioned elsewhere,
has founded an antipædobaptist sect. Indeed,
I see in the papers advertisements of half-a-dozen
works that have lately appeared on the subject.
Another specimen of this wall-literature was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
collection of Norwegian proverbs, one of which
might perhaps serve to reconcile an explorer in
this country to indifferent accommodation. “The
poor man’s house is his palace.” Another proverb
rebuked pride, in the following manner:&mdash;“Dust
is still dust, although it rise to heaven.”</p>

<p>Next day we pass a solitary farmstead, which
my attendant informs me is called Skarp England
(<i>i.e.</i>, scanty, not deep-soiled, meadow-land). Were
it not for those Angles, the generally reputed godfathers
of England, one would almost be inclined
to derive the name of our country from that
green, meadow (eng) like appearance which must
have caught the attention of the immigrant Jutes
and Saxons. At least, such is the surmise of Professor
Radix.</p>

<p>“And what road is that?” I asked, pointing to a
very unmacadamized byway through the forest.</p>

<p>“It is called Prest-vei (the Priest’s-way), because
that is the road the clergyman has to take
to get to one of his distant churches.”</p>

<p>“Gee up!” said I to the horse, a young one,
and unused to his work, adding a slight flip with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the whip (Svöbe), a compliment which the colt
returned by lashing out with his heels.</p>

<p>“Hilloa, Erik! this won’t do; it’s quite dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, he has no back shoes; he won’t hurt
you&mdash;except,” he afterwards added, “out of fun
he should happen to strike a little higher.”</p>

<p>The ill-omened shriek of a couple of jays
which crossed the road diverted my attention,
and I asked their Norwegian name, which I found
to be “skov-shur” (wood-magpie) in these parts.</p>

<p>As we skirt the western bank of the Kile Fjord,
a fresh-water lake, a dozen miles long, and
abounding in fish (meget fiskerig), the man points
to me a spot on the further shore where the Torrisdal
River, after flowing through the lake,
debouches by a succession of falls in its course
to Vigeland and the sea at Christiansand.</p>

<p>At every station the question is, “Are you
going up to the copper works?” These are at
Valle, a long way up the valley. They have been
discontinued some years, but, it is said, are now
likely to be re-opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>At Ketilsaa I am recommended to call on the
Foged of the district, a fine, hearty sexagenarian,
who gave me much valuable information respecting
this singular valley and its inhabitants;
besides which, what I especially valued under
the circumstances, he set before me capital home-brewed
beer, port wine, Trondjem’s aquavit, not
to mention speil aeg (poached eggs) and bear
ham. Bear flesh is the best <i>travel</i> of all, say
the Greenlanders, so I did not spare the last.
The superstitions and tales about Huldra and
fairies (here called jügere) are, the Foged tells
me, dying out hereabout, though not higher up
the valley.</p>

<p>His foster-son,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a jolly-looking gentleman, sends
off a messenger to see if his own horse is near
at hand, in order that I may not be detained by
waiting for one at the neighbouring station,
Fahret. But the pony is somewhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
forest, so that his benevolent designs cannot be
realized. Altogether, I have never visited any
house in Norway where intelligence, manliness,
and good-nature seemed so thoroughly at home
as at the Foged’s.</p>

<p>The station-master, Ole Gundarson Fahret,
manages to get me a relay in one hour; in the
interval we have a palaver.</p>

<p>“There was once an Englishman here,” said
he, “who went out bear-hunting with the greatest
bear-shooter of these parts, Nils Olsen Breistöl;
but they did not happen on one. Breistöl has
shot fifteen bears.”</p>

<p>“How does he manage to find them in the
trackless forest?”</p>

<p>“Why he is continually about, and he knows
of a great many bears’ winter-lairs (Björn-hi);
and when the bear is asleep, he goes and pokes
him out.”</p>

<p>“But is it not dangerous?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes. There was a great bear who was
well known for fifty miles round, for he was as grey as
a wolf, and lame of one leg, having been injured, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was thought, in a fight with a stallion. He killed
a number of horses; and great rewards were
offered to the killer of him. The people in
Mandal, to the west, offered thirty dollars; he had
been very destructive down there. Well, Breistöl
found out where he lay one winter, and went up
with another man. Out he comes, and tries to
make off. They are always ræd (frightened) at
first, when they are surprised in their lair. But
Breistöl sent a ball into him (this Norsk Mudjekeewis,
by-the-bye, makes his own rifles), and the
bear stopped short, and rushed at him. Just at
this moment, however, he got another bullet from
the other man, which stopped him. After waiting
for a moment, he turned round, and charged at
the new aggressor, who dodged behind a tree;
meanwhile, Breistöl had loaded, and gave him
another ball; and so they kept firing and dodging;
and it actually took fifteen balls to kill him, he
was so big and strong. The last time they fired,
they came close to him, and shot two bullets into
his head, only making one hole; then he died.
The usual reward from the Government is five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
dollars, but Breistöl got fifteen. The Mandal
people, when they heard the great grey bear was
dead, gave him nothing. Fand (fiend)! but
he was immensely big (uhyr stor), so fat and
fleshy.”</p>

<p>“And how long does the bear sleep in winter?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“He goes in about Sanct Michael’s-tid, and
comes out at the beginning of April.”</p>

<p>“And how many bears are there in one hole?”</p>

<p>“Only one; unless the female has young late
in the autumn. A man in these parts once found
an old he-bear (Manden), with a she-bear, and
three young cubs, all in one hole. I think there
are as many bears as ever there were in the
country. There was a lad up in the forest, five
years ago; a bear struck at him, but missed him,
only getting his cap, which stuck on the end of
his claws. This seemed to frighten the brute, and
he made off. The little boy didn’t know what a
danger he had escaped; he began to cry for the
loss of his cap, and wanted to go after it. Now
that did not happen by chance. V Herre Gud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
har Hannd i slig (God our master has a hand in
such like things). We have a proverb, that the bear
has ten men’s strength, and the wit of twelve;
but that’s neither here nor there. Björnen kan
vaere meget staerk, men han faa ikke Magt at
draebe mennesker, Mnaar Han ikke tillade det.
(The bear may be very strong, but he has not the
power to kill men unless He permits it.”)</p>

<p>In which proper sentiment I of course acquiesced,
and took leave of the intelligent Schusskaffer.</p>

<p>My attendant on the next stage, Ole Michelsen
Vennefoss, derived his last name from the great
cataract on the Otterelv, near which he lives. It
is now choked up with timber. But all this, he
tells me, will move in the autumn, when the water
rises; although, in the north of the country, the
rivers at that time get smaller and smaller, and, in
winter time, with the ice that covers them, occupy
but a small part of the accustomed bed.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a friend of his had a narrow
escape at these falls: the boat he was in turned
over just above the descent, and he disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from view; down hurried the boat, and providentially
was not smashed to pieces. At the bottom
of the fall it caught against a rock, and righted
again, and up bobbed the drowned man, having
been under the boat all the time. His friends
managed to save him.</p>

<p>On the road we overtake a man driving, who
offers me schnaps in an excited manner.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Ole, mournfully, “he has been to the
By, and bought some brantviin; they never can
resist the temptation. When he gets home, there
will be a Selskab (party). People for miles round
know where he has been, and they will come
and hear the news, and drink themselves drunk.”</p>

<p>Ole is one of the so-called Lesere, or Norwegian
Methodists, disciples of Hauge, whose son is the
clergyman of a parish near here. They may often
be detected by their drawling way of speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, Ole,” said I, “did you ever see any of
these bears they talk so much about?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that I have. I saw the old lame bear
that Breistöl shot. I was up at the stöl (châlet)
four years ago come next week, with my two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sisters. We were sitting outside the building,
just about this time of the evening, when it was
getting dusk; all of a sudden, the horse came
galloping to us as hard as ever he could tear. I
knew at once it was a bear; and, sure enough, close
behind him, came the beast rushing out of the
wood. We all raised a great noise and shouting,
on which the bear stopped, and ran away. Poor
blacky had a narrow escape; he bears the marks
of the bear’s claws on his hind quarters. I could
put my four fingers in them.”</p>

<p>Quite so, hummed I&mdash;</p>

<p>“But what do the bears eat, when they can’t get
cattle?”</p>

<p>“Grass, and berries, and ants (myren).”</p>

<p>“But don’t the ants sting him?”</p>

<p>“Oh! no; no such thing. A friend of mine
saw a bear come to one of those great ant-hills
you have passed in the woods. He put out his
tongue, and laid it on the ant-hill till it was
covered with ants, and then slipped it back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his mouth. They can’t hurt him, his tongue is
too thick-skinned for that.”</p>

<p>“Does the bear eat anything in winter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, I believe. I have seen one or two
that were killed then; their stomach was as empty
as empty&mdash;wanted no cleaning at all. I think
that’s the reason they are such cowards then. I
have always more pluck when my stomach is full.
Hav’n’t you?”</p>

<p>It struck me that there are many others besides
the artless Norwegian who, if they chose, must
confess to a similar weakness.</p>

<p>“But the wolves (ulven) don’t go to sleep in
winter; what do they eat?”</p>

<p>“Ulven?&mdash;what’s that?”</p>

<p>“I mean Graa-been (grey-legs).”</p>

<p>“Ah! you mean Skrüb.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In winter they steal
what they can, and, when hard pressed, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
devour a particular sort of clay. That’s well
known; it’s plain to see from their skarn (dung.)”</p>

<p>Ole further tells me that a pair of eagles build
in a tall tree about a mile from his house. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
young ones have just flown; he had not time to
take them, although there is a reward of half-a-dollar
a-head. Fancy a native of the British
Isles suffering an eagle to hatch, and fly off with
its brood in quiet.</p>

<p>“Hvor skal de ligge inat?” (where shall you lie
to-night?) he inquired, as we proceeded.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall go further than Guldsmedoen,
to-night,” I replied.</p>

<p>“There is no accommodation at all at the
station,” he said; “but at Senum, close by, you
can get a night’s lodging.”</p>

<p>It was dark when we arrived at Senum, which
lay down a break-neck side-path, where the man
had to lead the horse. On our tapping at the
door, a female popped her head out of a window,
but said nothing. After a pause, my man says
“Quells,” literally, whiling, or resting-time. This
was an abbreviation for “godt quell” (good evening).
“Quells” was the monosyllabic reply of the still
small voice at the porthole.</p>

<p>“Tak for senast” (thanks for the last), was my
guide’s next observation.</p>

<p>“Tak for senast,” the other responded from above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The ice being now somewhat broken, the
treble of “the two voices” inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>“What man is that with you?”</p>

<p>“A foreigner, who wants a night’s lodging.”</p>

<p>Before long, the farmer and his wife were busy
upstairs preparing a couch for me, with the
greatest possible goodwill; nor would they hear of
Ole returning home that night, so he, too,
obtained sleeping quarters somewhere in the establishment.</p>

<p>I find, what the darkness had prevented me from
seeing, that this house is situated at the southern
end of the Aarfjord, a lake of nearly forty miles
in length. Mine host has this evening caught a lot
of fine trout in the lake with the nets. They are
already in salt&mdash;everything is salted in this
country&mdash;but I order two or three fat fellows out
of the brine, and into some fresh water against
the morning, when they prove excellent. So red
and fat! The people here say they are better than
salmon.</p>

<p>Rain being the order of the next day, I post up
my journal. In the afternoon I resume my journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
by the road on the further side of the lake.
Until very lately a carriage road was unknown
here. The Fogderi, or Bailewick, in which we
now are, is called Robygd: a reminiscence, it is
said, of the days not long since over, when the
sole means of locomotion up the valley (bygd) was
to row (roe). The vehicle being a common cart,
with no seat, a bag is stuffed with heather for me
to sit on; and this acts as a buffer to break the
force of the bumps which the new-made road and
the springless cart kept giving each other, while,
in reality, it was I that came in for the brunt of
the pommelling. The Norwegian driver sat on the
hard edge of the cart, regardless of the shocks, and
as tough apparently as the birch-wood of which the
latter was composed. It won’t do for a person who
is at all <i>made-up</i> to risk a journey in Sætersdal: he
would infallibly go to pieces, and the false teeth
be strewed about the path after the manner of
those of the serpent or dragon sown by Jason on
the Champ de Mars. Armed men rose from the earth
on that occasion, and something of the kind took
place now. Don’t start, reader, it was only in story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look at that hole,” said my attendant, pointing
to an opening half-way up the limestone cliff, surrounded
by trees and bushes. “That is the&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cave of the Dragon?” interrupted I, abstractedly.</p>

<p>“The Tyve Helle (thieves’ cave), which goes in
one hundred feet deep. For a long time they
were the terror of all Sætersdal. The only
way to the platform in front of the cave was
by a ladder. One of their band, who pretended
to be a Tulling (idiot), used to go
begging at the farm-houses, and spying how the
ground lay.</p>

<p>“On one occasion they carried off along with
some cattle the girl who tended them. Poor
soul! she could not escape, they kept such a
sharp watch on her. The captain of the band
meanwhile wanted to marry her; she pretended
to like the idea, and the day before that fixed
for the wedding asked leave just to go down
to the farm where she used to live and steal the
silver Brudestads (bridal ornaments), which were
kept there. The thieves gave her leave;&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
could dispense with the parson, but not with this.
But first they made her swear she would not speak
to a soul at the house. At midnight, Asjer, as she
was called, arrived at her former home, to the
astonishment of the good folks. She at once
proceeded to take a piece of white linen, a scrap
of red home-spun cloth, and a pair of shears. This
done, she went to the chimney-corner and told the
pinewood-beam, ‘I have been stolen by robbers;
they live in a cave in the forest, I will cut little
bits of red cloth on the road to it; to-morrow the
captain marries me. To-night, when they are all
drunk and asleep, I will hang out the piece of
white cloth.’ Without exchanging a word with the
inmates, she then set off back. The master of the
house and a few friends collected, and followed her
track. At night-fall they saw the flag waved from
the mouth of the cave. In they rushed upon the
thieves, who, unable to escape, threw themselves
over the precipice. The captain, suspecting her
to be the author of the surprise, seized her
by the apron as he dashed over the ledge,
determined that she should die with him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the leader of the bonders, a ready-witted fellow,
cut her apron-strings with his knife, just in
the nick of time, so that she was saved; and
the robber, in his fall, took nothing with him but
her apron.”</p>

</div>

<p>Close by Langerack we pass a wolf-trap (baas),
formed on the principle of our box-trap, for catching
rats, only that the material is thick pine-boles
fastened side by side. More than one wolf and
lynx have been caged here.</p>

<p>The heather still continues plentiful; I particularly
note this, as in the more northerly parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the country, <i>e.g.</i>, about Jerkin, this beautiful vestiture
of the rocks and moors is seldom seen, except
in very little bits. What a pity that none of our
British grouse proper (<i>Tetrao Scoticus</i>) return the
visit of the Norwegian ptarmigan to Scotland, and
found a colony in these parts; they would escape at
all events those systematic traffickers in ornithological
blood, by whom these unfortunates are bought
and sold as per advertisement. Blackcock and
capercailzie, as usual, are to be found in the lower
woods, and ptarmigan higher up. About here there
are no trees of large size remaining; the best have
long since been cut down and floated to the sea.
It would do a nurseryman’s heart good to see the
groups of hardy little firs, self-sown, sprouting up
in every crevice with an exuberance of health and
strength, and asserting their right to a hearing
among the soughing branches of their taller neighbours,
who rise patronizingly above them. The
seed falling upon stony ground does not fail to
come up, notwithstanding, and bring forth fruit a
hundred-fold and more.</p>

<p>The valley here, which has been opening ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
since I left Vennefoss, continues to improve in
looks; it is now almost filled by the Fjord, and
appears to come to an end some distance higher
up, by the intervention of a block of mountains;
but if there be any truth in the map, this is an
optical delusion, the valley running up direct
northward, nearly one hundred and fifty miles from
Christiansand, and reaching a height at Bykle of
nearly two thousand feet above the sea.</p>

<p>At the clean and comfortable station of Langerack
I light upon a treasure in the shape of a
dozen or two of hens’ eggs; very small indeed, it is
true, as they were not quite so big as a bantam’s.
Six of these I immediately take, and an old lady,
with exceedingly short petticoats, commences frying
them, while I grind the coffee which she has
just roasted.</p>

<p>After a goodly entertainment, for part of
which I was indebted to my own wallet, I go with
her to the Stabur, or store-room, where, with evident
pride and pleasure, she shows me all her
valuables; conspicuous among these was a full set
of bridal costume, minus the crown, which was let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
out. The bridal belt was of yellow leather, and
covered with silver-gilt ornaments, all of the same
pattern, to each of which is suspended a small
bracteate of the same metal, which jingles with
every step of the bride. What particularly attracted
my attention were the three woollen petticoats
worn by the bride one over the other. The
first is of a dingy white colour, and is, in fact, the
same as the every-day dress of the females. The
second is of blue cloth, with red and green stripes
round the bottom. The third, which is worn
outermost, is of scarlet, with gold and green edging.
Of course if these were all of the same length
the under-ones would not be visible; and thus the
object of wearing such a heap of clothes&mdash;love of
display&mdash;would be defeated; so, while the undermost
is long, the next is less so, and the next
shorter still. Each one is very heavy, so the
weight of the three together must be great indeed.
The whole reminds one of harlequin at a country
fair. But, while he comes on unwieldily and shabbily
dressed, and as he takes off one coat and waistcoat
after another grows smarter and smarter, and at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
fines down into a gay harlequin, the Norwegian
bride, by a contrary process, grows smarter and
smarter with each article of clothing that she assumes.</p>

<p>The most remarkable thing about these bridal
petticoats is the skirt behind, which is divided
by plaits like the flutings of a Doric column;
while these, towards the bottom or base bulge out
into two or three rounded folds, which stick out
considerably from the person. Hear this, ye Miss
Weazels, who condemn crinoline as a new-fangled
institution, whereas in fact the idea is evidently
taken from the primæval customs of Sætersdal.
The support of this dead weight of clothing are
not, as might be expected, the hips, for the whole
system of integuments comes right up over the
bosom, and is upheld by a couple of very short
braces or shoulder-straps. A jacket under these
circumstances is almost superfluous. It is of blue
cloth with gold edging, and only reaches down to
the arm-holes.</p>

<p>These vestments are no doubt of very ancient
cut. In the district of Lom another sort of dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was once the fashion. The coat was of white
wadmel, with dark coloured embroidery, and silver
buttons as big as a dollar. The collar stood up.
The waistcoat was scarlet, and also embroidered.
White knee-breeches of wash-leather, garters of
coloured thread, and shoes adorned with large
silver buckles, set off the lower man. This dress
went out at the beginning of the century. In
Romerike, and elsewhere, there was on the back of
the coat a quaint piece of embroidery pointing up
like the spire of a church, and green, red, or blue,
according to the parish of the wearer. At the
public masquerades in Christiania, these dresses
may still be seen.</p>

<p>But I had forgotten the old lady in the contemplation
of the wardrobe. She appears to think she
shall make me understand her jargon better by
shouting in my ears&mdash;a common mistake&mdash;and
while she does so, she skips about the chamber
with all the agility of the old she-goat before the
door. The proverb says, “Need makes the old
wife run,” but she ran without any apparent cause.
Finally, in her enthusiasm, she goes the length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
putting one of these petticoats on&mdash;don’t be
alarmed, fair reader&mdash;<i>over</i> her own, to show me
how it looks. Besides the above state apparel,
mutton and pork-hams, with other comestibles, find
a secure place in the store-room.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room of the house is a remarkable
picture of our Saviour on the cross, with various
quaint devices round it. It is known to be more
than three hundred years old, and no doubt dates
from the Roman Catholic times. Like most of the
peasants, who are exceedingly tenacious of these
“Old-sager” (old-world articles), the master of the
house won’t part with the picture for any consideration.</p>

<p>As a boat is procurable, I determine to vary the
mode of travelling by going by water to the station
&mdash;&mdash;, and the more so as this will enable me
to try for a trout while I am resting my shaken
limbs. There being no wind to ruffle the water, I
only took one or two trout. A man on the lake,
who was trailing a rough-looking fly, was not a
little astonished at my artificial minnow. The Fjord
is very fine. Pretty bays, nestling under the bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
lofty mountains, and here and there a beach of
yellow sand, fringing a grassy slope, while behind
these, Scotch fir, birch, and aspen throw their
shadows over the water.</p>

<p>“You see that odde (point),” says my old waterman;
“that is Lobdal point. It was just there
that Priest Brun had the misfortune to be lost,
twenty years ago come Yule. He had been preaching
down below, at one of his four churches, and
was sleighing home again on the ice. The Glocker
(precentor) was driving behind him, when he saw
him suddenly disappear, horse and all. It was a
weak place in the ice, and, there being snee-dicke
(snow-thickness) at the time, the priest had not
seen any symptoms of danger. Poor man, I knew
him well; he was a very good person. He never
received Christian burial, for his body was never
found.” Such are the incidents that checquer the
life of a Norwegian parson.</p>

<p>It was so nearly dark when we arrived at &mdash;&mdash;,
that we had a difficulty in finding the landing-place,
to which, however, we were guided by something
that looked like a house in the gloaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“And where am I to lodge?” asked I of the
boatman. “Is the station far off?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a good distance. You had best lie at
Priest &mdash;&mdash;’s, there.”</p>

<p>“But I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“That does not matter the least. He is forfaerdelig
gjestfri (frightfully hospitable) og meget
snil (and very good).”</p>

<p>So I make bold to grope my way to the house,
and, finding the door, tap at it. It is opened by a
short, good-humoured looking person, the clergyman
himself, who quiets the big dog that I had kept
at bay with my fishing-rod, asks me who I am, and
bids me come in and be welcome, as if he had
known me all the days of my life. Few minutes
elapse before I am eating cold meat and drinking
ale; during the repast chatting with my host on
all sorts of matters. Supper ended, he shows me
to the best chamber, or stranger’s room, where I
am soon reposing luxuriously under an eider-down
coverlet. This I kicked off in my slumbers, it
being evidently too hot for an Englishman in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
summer time, even in Norway. What delightful
things these eider-downs must be in the cold of
a northern winter.</p>

<p>A young female servant, Helvig by name, brings
my boots in the morning. She was clad in the
working-day dress of the country maidens. To
begin with the beginning, or her head. It is covered
with a coloured cotton couvrechef. Her masculine
chemise is fastened at the throat by two enormous
studs of silver filigree, bullet shaped, and is, below
this, further confined by a silver brooch (Norwegicè
“ring”), shaped like a heart. Her petticoat,
which covers very little of her black worsted stockings,
makes up for its shortcomings in that direction,
by reaching right up above her bosom. It is
of a dingy white wool, and is edged with three
broad stripes of black. On Sunday her petticoat
is black, with red or blue edging.</p>

<p>She brings me her tartan of red wool with
white stripes for my inspection. It is called
“kjell,” a word which occurs in the old ballad of
“The Gay Goss Hawk.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then up and got her seven sisters,</div>
<div class="verse">And sewed to her a kell.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">There it means pall, but the Norwegian word is
also used of any coverlet. The maidens wear it
just like a Parisian lady would her shawl, <i>i.e.</i>,
below the shoulders, and tight over the elbows.
The married women, however, carry it like the
Scotch plaid, over one shoulder and under the
other arm, with their baby in the kolpos, or sinus,
in front.</p>

<p>This article of dress, which is sometimes white,
striped with red&mdash;the stripes being most frequent
at the ends&mdash;and also the above manner of wearing
it, are thought to corroborate the tradition that
these people are a Scotch colony. The language,
too, contains many words not known elsewhere in
Norway, but used in England. Instead of “skee,”
they say “spon,” which is nothing but the Icelandic
“spónn,” and our “spoon.” In the words
kniv (knife), and knap (button), the k is silent
before n; whereas, elsewhere in Norway, it is pronounced.
L, too, is silent before d, as with us;
“skulde” (should) being pronounced “skud,” or
“shud.” The common word for a river in Norway
is “elv;” here it is “aas,” pronounced “ose,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which is nothing but the frequent “ooze” of
England, meaning, in fact, “a stream generally.”</p>

<p>“What sort of people are the peasants about
here?” I asked of the priest.</p>

<p>“They have many peculiarities. Formerly, they
were looked upon by the rest of Norway as a kind
of Abderites, stupid fellows; but they are not so
much stupid, far from it, as quaint and comical.
Indeed, their dress makes them look odd and
simple. You must know that ten years ago the
only road up the valley was by water, and about
the only travellers the priest and a merchant or two.
These Westland people are very different from the
Eastlanders; for, whereas the latter are more ‘alvorlig’
(serious), and ‘modig’ (plucky), these
are more ‘blid’ (gentle), more ‘dorsk’ and
‘doven’ (lazy and indolent), and fond of sleeping
three times a day. Formerly they were inveterate
fatalists, so much so that for a long time they
would not hear of going to a doctor, if they were
ill, or an accident happened. They used also to
believe in Trolls (fairies), but that is fast exploding
hereabouts. Yet they are still impressed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
belief in ‘giengângere’ (wraiths), and that the
powers of evil are supernaturally at work around
us. This makes them so fearful of going out after
dark. Of late years a great change has been
wrought among many of them, since the sect of
the Lesere, or Haugians, began to prevail. They
have forsworn Snorro Sturleson’s Chronicle and
the historical Sagas of the country, which the Norwegian
bonder used to be fond of reading, and in
their cottages you will find nothing but the Bible
and books of devotion. To read anything else
they consider sinful, as being liable to turn away
their minds from spiritual objects.”</p>

<p>“And do you think that, practically, they are
better Christians?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly some of them are God-fearing
persons, while others only adopt this tone from
motives of self-interest.”</p>

<p>“How comes it that there are so few people
about?”</p>

<p>“Ah! I must tell you. There is one remarkable
custom in the valley&mdash;indeed, it is not impossible
that it derives its name, Sætersdal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
(Valley of Sæters), from it.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> During the summer
the sæter is not inhabited by a single girl
with her cows, as elsewhere in Norway, but by
the whole of the farmer’s family. At such times
I have no parishioners. They are all off. For
the last three Sundays I have had no service.
Each farmer possesses two or three of these
sæters or stöls, and when they have cut the grass,
and the cattle has eaten up the alpine shrubs at
one spot, they move to another. It is a regular
nomadic life as long as it lasts, which is the
best part of the summer.</p>

<p>“In the winter, the hay made in the summer
is brought down from the mountain on sledges.
The snow being very deep, the ponies would
sink in but for a contrivance called ‘trug,’
which is peculiar to these parts of Norway. Here
is one,” said he, as Helvig, with great alacrity,
brought in the apparatus in question. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
strong hoop of birch-wood, about a foot in diameter.
From its sides ran four iron chains, of
two or three links each, to a ring in the centre.
Attached to the hoop was some wicker-work.
Into this basket the pony’s foot is inserted, and
the wicker secured to the fetlock, while the shoe
rests on the iron ring and chains. Armed with
this anti-sinking machine, the horse keeps on the
surface, and can travel with tolerable expedition.
Men wear a similar contrivance, but smaller.</p>

<p>“Are there any bauta-stones, or such-like reminiscences
of olden times in this part of the
valley?”</p>

<p>“Very few. From its secluded position it never
was of any great historical note. It is near the
sea that the Vikings were most at home, and
left behind them memorials. Here is an old
cross-bow and an axe, such as the bonders used
to carry.”</p>

<p>These axes were called “hand-axes,” from the
fact that, when not otherwise used, the wearer
took the iron in his hand, and used the weapon
as a walking-stick. Sometimes they were even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
taken to church (see <i>Oxonian in Norway</i>, 2nd
edition, p. 336). This one had the date 1651
inscribed upon it, and, together with the handle,
was adorned with figuring. In the passage I also
saw a halbert and a spear, and a round spoon,
on which was inscribed the date 1614, and the
legend, “Mit haab til Gud” (My hope in God).</p>

<p>“Have you a good breed of cattle here?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly. We get all ours from
Fyrrisdal, four Norsk miles to the east of this.
The best ‘qvaeg-răcĕ’ in all Norway is to be found
there.”</p>

<p>“I see all your horses are stallions. They
must be very troublesome. I drove two or three
marked with severe bites.”</p>

<p>“That may be; but the bonders here, most of
whom have only one horse, find them answer their
purpose best. The stallion is never off his feed,
even after the hardest work, and will eat anything.
Besides which, he is much more enduring, and can
manage to drive off a wolf, provided he is not
hobbled.”</p>

<p>“Are there many bears about this summer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. A man called Herjus, of Hyllestad,
which you will pass, has been some weeks
in our doctor’s hands from wounds received from
a bear. He and another were in the forest, when
they fell in with a young bear, which immediately
climbed up a tree. The other man went to cut
a stick, while Herjus threw stones at the cub.
Suddenly he hears a terrific growl, and at the
same moment receives a tremendous blow on the
head. It was the female bear, who, like all female
bears in a passion, had walked up to him, biped
fashion, and, with a ‘take that for meddling with
my bairn,’ felled him to the ground. Over him,”
continued the parson, “fell the bear, so blinded
with rage, that she struck two or three blows
beyond him. His companion had made a clean
pair of heels of it. The bear next seized the
unfortunate wight in her arms, and dragged him
to a precipice for the purpose of hurling him over.
Herjus at once feigned to be dead, that he might
not become so. The bear perceiving this, and
thinking it no use to give herself any more trouble
about a dead man, left him. Fearful lest she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
should return, he scrambled down the steep, and
got over a stream below. It is said that the bears,
like witches, don’t like to cross a running stream;
that was the reason of his movement. It was
lucky he did so, for no sooner was he over than
the bear came back to see that all was right, and
perceived that she had been hoaxed, but did not
attempt to follow.”</p>

<p>“But do the bears really drag people over
precipices?”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>“It is said so. Near Stavanger a poor fellow
was attacked by a bear, who skinned his face from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
scalp to chin, and then dragged him through the
trees to a precipice. At this horrible instant the
poor wretch clutched a tree, and hung to it with
such desperation, that the bear, who heard help
coming, left him, and retreated. The king has
given him a pension of thirty-five dollars a-year.”</p>

<p>“And the wolves?” asked I.</p>

<p>“There are plenty of them. I caught one not
long ago with strychnine. The doctor, who has
lately left, caught a great many one winter. Brun,
my predecessor, who was drowned, took seven
wolves in one night with poison, close by the
parsonage. They are also taken in the baas
(<i>i.e.</i>, such a trap as I described above). Some
winters there are very few, while at other times
they abound. A fjeld-frass (glutton) was not long
ago taken in a trap. We have also lynxes of
two sorts&mdash;the katte-gaupe (cat-lynx), which is
yellow, with dark spots; and the skrübb-gaupe
(wolf-lynx), which is wolf-coloured.”</p>

<p>The church, like all modern Norwegian churches,
is neat, but nothing more. Its very ancient predecessor,
which was pulled down a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ago, abounded, like most of those built in Roman
Catholic times, with beautiful wood-carving. Near
the church is a fine sycamore, two hundred years
old, and three picturesque weeping birches. Oaks,
I find, ceased at Guldsmedoen.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the priest, in the course of conversation,
“this is a marvellous country, when
you consider its peculiar nature&mdash;more barren
rock by far than anything else. And yet our
opkomst (progress) is wonderful since we became
a free nation. With a population of less than a
million and a half, we have a mercantile marine
second only to that of England. We have as
much freedom as is consistent with safety; the
taxes are light, and the overplus, after paying
the expenses of the Government, is devoted to
internal improvements. None of it goes to
Sweden, as it did formerly to Denmark; it is all
spent on the country. Yes, sir, everything thrives
better in a free country; the air is healthier, the
very trees grow better.”</p>

<p>Sentiments like these, which are breathed by
every Norskman, of course found a cordial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
response from an Englishman. I only hope that
Norway will be suffered to go on progressing
uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>Never having seen the interior of what is called
the Bad-hus (bath-house), I go with my host to
see this regular appendage to all country-houses.
The traveller in Norway has no doubt often seen
at some distance from the main house a log-hut,
round the door of which the logs are blackened
by smoke. This is the bad-hus. The millstones
in this country are so indifferent, that it is
found necessary to bake the corn previous to
grinding it. It is thus performed. In the centre
of the log-house, which is nearly air-proof, is a
huge stone oven heaped over with large stones.
Near the roof within are shelves on which the
grain is placed; a wood fire is then lit in the
oven, the door of the but is closed, and the
temperature inside soon becomes nearly equal
to that of the oven itself, and the corn speedily
dries.</p>

<p>It is said that this name, “bad-hus,” is derived
from a custom which formerly prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
among the people of using this receptacle in
winter time as a kind of hot-air bath. The
peasant, also, put it to another use. Not being
the cleanliest people in the world, their bed-clothes
become at times densely inhabited. When
the colony becomes overstocked, the clothes are
brought hither, and a short spell of the infernal
temperature proves too much for the small
animals, as they are not blessed with the heat-enduring
capabilities of the cricket or salamander.
In fact, the clothes become literally too hot
to hold them, and they share the fate of Higginbottom.</p>

<p>This reminds me of an old tale concerning one
Staale, of Aasheim, not very far from here. This
man had murdered his brother about two hundred
and fifty years ago. His life was spared on condition
that he would rid the country of seven
outlaws who harried the country and defied every
attempt to take them. Staale, who was a daredevil
villain, having discovered their retreat, went
thither in rags, and showing them that he was a
bird of similar plumage, proposed forgathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with them. The robbers were charmed at the
idea of such an accession to their number. Meanwhile,
Staale complained that his rags were full of
parasites, and at his request a huge kettle was hung
over the fire for the purpose of boiling the creatures
out. As soon as the water boiled Staale
dashed the fluid into the faces of the robbers who
lay asleep on the floor, not expecting so warm a
reception. Thus reduced, for the moment at least,
to a condition like that of that precious brigand,
Polyphemus, they fell an easy prey to Staale, who
dashed their brains out with a crow-bar. He was,
however, near being overmastered by an old
woman who ministered to the wants of the robbers,
like the delicate Leonarda in <i>Gil Blas</i>, and had
escaped the baptism that had been administered to
the rest. After a hard struggle, however, he overcame
the virago, and thus obtained his life and
freedom, which had been forfeited for his misdeeds.</p>

<p>In the bad-hus were also suspended the winter
cloak of his Reverence, composed of six beautiful
wolf-skins; the sledge-apron, made of a huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
black bear-skin, with the fur leggings and gloves,
also used to keep out the cold in driving. These
articles are generally hung up in another part of
the premises, the ammoniacal vapours of which
are much disliked and avoided by moths and other
fur-destroyers.</p>

</div>

<p>Taking leave with many thanks of my worthy
host and the young lady who is presiding in the
absence of his wife, both of whom had shown me
no small kindness, I start by boat up the lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
The priest has no less than fourteen Huusmaend
(see <i>Oxonian in Norway</i>, p. 8), and one of them,
Knut, undertakes to row me up to Froisnaes. His
dress is that of the country. Trousers up to the
neck-hole of grey wadmel, striped at the sides
with a streak of black, and fastened with four
buttons at the ankles&mdash;the button-holes worked
with green worsted ending in red.</p>

<p>As usual, I killed two birds with one stone&mdash;advancing
northward, and catching trout at the
same time. I had flies as well as a minnow trailing
behind, and took fish with both, the biggest about
a pound weight.</p>

<p>“That’s not a trout; that’s a Bleke,” exclaimed
Knut, as I hauled in a fish of about the same
weight, but which pulled with a strength beyond
his size. They are much fatter and of finer flavour
than the trout. By subsequent experience I found
Knut to be right. Such a fish at the <i>Trois
Frères</i> would fetch its weight in silver. The
flesh was paler than that of the trout. Externally,
it was of a beautiful dark green on the back,
while the sides were whitish, but shaded with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
light green. The spots were more purple than
those of the trout, while the head and extremity
of the body before the tail tapered beautifully. It
somewhat resembled a herring in shape: Knut
compared it to a mackerel. They never, he said,
exceed a pound in weight, but are stronger than a
trout of equal size. Here, then, was a species of
fish totally unknown to Great Britain. Indeed,
there are many fish in Scandinavia which it would
be worth while to try and naturalize among us.
The cross, for instance, between a Jack and a
Perch to be found in the Swedish lakes, and better
than either; why does not Lord Breadalbane, the
second introducer of capercailzie into Scotland, or
some other patriot, apply his mind and resources
to this subject?</p>

<p>The trout in this lake run to an enormous size.
They have been seen two or three ells long. These
large fish are seldom visible, generally frequenting
the deeps. In all these waters the saying is, “we
catch most fish in the autumn” (til Hösten, Scoticè,
ha’st): <i>i.e.</i>, when the fish approach the shallows
to spawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The waters of the lake, which were in some
places from one to two miles broad, and studded
with wooded islands, now contract, and separate
into two narrow channels. Advantage is taken of
the situation to set up a log-trap below&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a
circle of logs fastened end to end with birchen
ropes rove through eye-holes. In this pound are
caught the timbers that have been floated down
from above. Hundreds of prisoners are thus
caged without any further fastening; but escape is
impossible, unless they leap over the barrier, or
dive beneath it, both which are forbidden by the
laws of gravity. If they were not thus formed
into gangs they would get playing the truant, and
lounging in the various bays, or become fixed fast
on shore. When the circle is full, advantage is
taken of the north wind which prevails, and off
the whole convoy is started down south without
any human attendants.</p>

<p>Before long we reach a very striking spot. The
lake, which had again widened, now narrows suddenly,
and the vast body of limpid water rushes
with tremendous rapidity through a deep groove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
about thirty feet wide, cut by Nature through
smooth sloping rocks. Ever and anon a log, which
has been floating lazily from above, and has, all on
a sudden, found itself in this hurly-burly, comes
shooting through in a state of the utmost agitation,
occasionally charging, like a battering-ram, at a
projecting angle of the wall; while others, with
no less impetuous eagerness, race through the
passage a dozen abreast; the outsiders, however,
get caught in the eternal backstream below, and
go bumping, shoving, and jostling each other
for hours before they can again escape from the
magic eddy.</p>

<p>The stream being too strong to admit of our
getting the parson’s boat up this defile&mdash;let alone
the perfect certainty of a smash if we attempt to
run the gauntlet through this band of Malays
running amuck&mdash;the boatman starts off with some
of my luggage on his shoulders to engage a boat
at the ferryman’s, lying through the pine grove.</p>

<p>While he is gone, I amuse myself with watching
the logs; and had I been gifted with the moralizing
powers of the melancholy Jacques, I might easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
have set down in the journal some apt comparisons
about the people of this world racing each
other in the battle of life, pushing, scrambling,
dashing other people out of their road. “If a man
gets in your way, stamp on him,” says one of
Thackeray’s people; and some of them suddenly
brought up all of a heap in the dark inexorable
round of one of life’s backstreams. The Storthing
has, I hear, at length decided that there shall be a
bridge thrown across this gully; the only wonder
is that it has not been done long ago, as it might
be built at a very trifling expense, and the foundations
are all ready to hand.</p>

<p>Above the lone hut of the ferryman, who is a
famous wood-carver, lies the new church of Sannes,
rising on some flat meadow land. What a contrast
that pure white image of it, reflected athwart the
waters, presents to the huge, dreary, threatening
shadows projected by yonder dark, weather-stained
masses of everlasting mountains. And yet, when the
rocks and mountains shall fall in universal ruin from
their lofty estate, that humble spire,&mdash;although,
perhaps, originally suggested by the towering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Igdrasil of Scandinavian Pagan mythology,&mdash;shall
rise still higher and higher, and pierce the clouds,
and the small, and seemingly perishable fane,
expand into the vast imperishable temple of the
God above.</p>

<p>From its various associations, such a sight as
that is very pleasing to the traveller in a lone
country like this, where Nature’s brow is almost
always contracted, frowning in gloomy, uncompromising
grandeur. No larks carolling blithely
up aloft; but instead, the scream of some bird of
prey, the grating croak of the raven, the demon
screech of the lom, or the hoarse murmur of the
angry waterfall.</p>

<p>At Froisnaes I spend the night, intending next
day to cross the lake, and walk over the mountains
opposite to another lake, called the Högvand, the
trout of which are renowned throughout the
valley. After undergoing the usual artillery of
questions and staring, I fall to discussing my
frugal meal of trout and potatoes, while the good
woman fills the bedstead with fresh straw. In
this she is assisted by one of her sons, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
trousers rise up to his gullet, and are actually kept
up by the silver studs of his shirt collar. These,
with a brooch, are the lad’s own handiwork, he
having learned the art of the silversmith from a
travelling descendant of Tubal Cain. He is very
anxious to buy a gold coin from me, and brings
half an old gold piece, and asks the value of it.
By poising it in the balance against half a
sovereign, I am enabled to guide him respecting
its true worth.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said the landlady, “the bed is
quite clear of fleas, though I won’t say there are
not some on the floor.”</p>

<p>Having no cream, she brings me her only egg,
which, after a sound drubbing, I force to do duty
as cream to my coffee. She laments that she has
no more eggs. All the family has been away at
the Stöl, and have only just returned, and the
thieving magpies took the opportunity, in lieu, I
suppose of the good luck which they bring to the
household, to suck the eggs as fast as the hen laid
them. Guardian angels of this description come
expensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The gude-man of the house, whose hair is cut
as short as Oliver Twist’s&mdash;probably for similar
reasons&mdash;with the exception of a scalping lock on
his forehead, now comes up the steep, unbanistered
stair to have a chat. The trout, he says, bite best a
week after St. Johann’s tid (June 21), that being,
no doubt, the time when the first flies appear.</p>

<p>Among other things, he tells me that about four
miles to the west of this, in a mountain valley
called Skomedal, there are the remains of an
ancient church, at a spot named Morstöl, <i>i.e.</i>, the
chalêt on the moors. Underneath it is a sort of crypt.
The graves, too, are plain to see. According to
the country side tradition, which is no doubt true
(for there never was such a country as this for preserving
traditions, as well as customs, unimpaired),
all the church-goers were exterminated by the black
death in the middle of the fourteenth century. The
people have not dared, says the man, to build any
fixed habitation there since, and the place is only
used as a summer pasture. More courage has
been shown elsewhere, as the following story will
show; but perhaps the real reason is, that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
valley it would not pay to build a gaard, the site
being very elevated and cold.</p>

<p>Where the great Gaard (Garth) of Mustad now
stands, there used, once on a time, to be a farmstead
called Framstad, the finest property in all
Vardal. But when “the great manqueller” visited
these parts, all the inhabitants of the valley, those
of Framstad among the number, were swept away,
and a century later it was only known in tradition
that the westernmost part of the valley had ever
been inhabited. One day a hunter lost himself in
the interminable forest which covered the district.
In vain he looked for any symptom of human
dwellings. After wandering about for a length of
time in a state of hopeless bewilderment, he suddenly
descried what looked like a house through
the trees, which were of immense age. All around
was so dreary and deserted that it was not without
a secret shudder he ventured into the building.
A strange sight met his eyes as he entered. On the
hearth was a kettle, half consumed by rust, and some
pieces of charcoal. On one of the heavy benches
which surrounded the fireplace lay a distaff, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
some balls of rotten thread, with other traces of
female industry. Against the wall hung a cross-bow,
and some other weapons; but everything was
covered with the dust of centuries. Surely there
must be some more vestiges of the former occupants,
thought he, as he clambered up into the loft
by the steep ladder. And sure enough there
were two great bedsteads, the solid timbers of
which were let into the end walls of the room. In
each of these were the mouldering skeletons of two
or more human beings.</p>

<p>Over these a number of mice were running, who,
frightened at his approach, hurried off in all directions.</p>

<p>He now remembered the tradition of the black
death. This must have been the dwelling of some
of the victims, left just in the state it was when
the hand of the Destroyer was suddenly laid upon
them. Being a shrewd fellow, he at once perceived
the value of his discovery, and with his
axe marked his name and the day of the month
on the wall of the building. As the day was
far spent, he kept watch and ward in the weird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
abode, and next day started eastward, where he
knew his home must lie, taking care to blaze the
trees on his road, as a clue to the spot. He
managed to get home safely, and before long returning
to the place with others, he soon cleared the
forest, and brought the old enclosures into cultivation.
In memory of his discovery he called his
new abode Mustad (Mouse Grange), the very name
by which it still goes; nay, his descendants are
said to be its present occupiers. In the eastern
and western walls of the garret the mortice holes
of the old bed-timbers are still visible. The date
is also distinguishable on one of the outside fir-timbers,
which are so intensely hard as almost to
defy the stroke of an axe.</p>

<p>A little higher up the main valley along which
I am travelling, and a little to the east of it,
there is another, called Findal, which is the scene
of the following curious legend. The plague only
spared two persons in this sequestered spot, a man
and his wife, Knut and Thore by name. They
were frightfully lonely, but still years rolled on, and
they never thought of quitting their ancient habitation.
The only thing that plagued them was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
how to count time, and at last they lost their
reckoning, and did not feel certain when the great
winter festival of Yule came round. It was agreed,
therefore, when the winter was at hand, and the
days rapidly shortening, that the old lady should
start off on foot, and go straight forward until she
found people to tell her the day of the month. She
went some distance, but the snow was so deep that
her knees got quite tired, and she sat down on the
Fond (snow-field), when suddenly, to her astonishment,
she heard the following words sung in a clear
quaint tone, by a voice under the snow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Deka deka Thole,</div>
<div class="verse">Bake du brouv te Jole:</div>
<div class="verse">Note ei,</div>
<div class="verse">Aa Dagana tvaei,</div>
<div class="verse">So laenge ae de ti Jole.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You there, my good Thole,</div>
<div class="verse">Bake you bread for Jule:</div>
<div class="verse">Nights one,</div>
<div class="verse">And days two,</div>
<div class="verse">So long it is to Jule.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old lady hurried back at once to her John
Anderson, and they kept the festival on the day
signified, which they felt sure was the right one, as
it afterwards turned out to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop Ullathorne and the other miracle-mongers
will, no doubt, fasten upon this legend as one to
be embodied in their next catalogue of supernatural
interventions in support of the Romish
faith, alongside of “Our Lady of Sallette,” and
other pretty stories. One might as well religiously
believe in those charming inventions of Ovid, to
which the imagination clings with such fondness,
so thoroughly are they intertwined with human
sympathies.</p>

<p>But let us get nearer our own time. Four years
ago, I hear, the people of the valley were terrified
by the apparition of a Scotchman, who had taken
it into his head to walk through Norway in full
Highland costume, armed with a hanger and a pair
of pistols. A man who saw him close to this
took him for the foul fiend, and made off into the
wood. Others, who were less alarmed, considered
him to be mad (gal). After a good deal of difficulty
he brought the folks to a parley, and not
knowing a word of Norsk, but being thirsty, he
asked for grog. The sailors on board the <i>Reine
Hortense</i> might have understood these four letters,
when signalled in Arctic waters by the aristocratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
owner of <i>The Foam</i>. Not so the Sætersdal people.
They thought he said “gröd,” and brought him a
lump of porridge. He then asked for “water,”
when they brought him a pair of large worsted
gloves (vanter), here pronounced vorter. This
reminds me of a friend of mine who arrived at a
station-house in a great state of hunger. He could
speak enough of the language to inquire for
provisions. “Porridge,” was the reply. “Anything
else?” “Beeren?” “Yes, by all means,”
exclaimed he, revelling in imagination on bear-collops.
The dame presently entered with a dish
of beeren, which consisted of&mdash;wild strawberries!&mdash;a
nice dessert, but not fitted for a <i>pièce de
résistance</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader will not object to be introduced
to some of the folks here nominally. Many
of the grand old names current in Sætersdal don’t
exist elsewhere in Norway, but are to be found in
the Sagas; and this is another proof of the
tenacity with which this part of the country
adheres to everything belonging to its forefathers.
Instead of such names as Jacob or Peder, we have
Bjorgulv, Torgrim, Torkil, Tallak, Gunstein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Herjus, Tjöstolf, Tarjei, Osuf, Aamund, Aanund,
Grunde; while the women answer to such Christian
names as Durdei, Gjellaug, Svalaug, Aslaug (feminine
of Aslack), Asbjorg (feminine of Asbjörn),
Sigrid (feminine of Sigur), and Gunvor. The dog,
even, who comes up into the loft, and seems
anxious to make my acquaintance, is called
Storm.</p>

<p>As the next morning is rainy, I look about the
premises for anything noteworthy. In one corner
is a bundle of thin strips of bark. These are
taken from the branches of the linden-tree, and
steeped in water from spring to autumn. They
are then separated into shreds, and woven by the
peasants into ropes, which are not so durable, however,
as those of hemp. A bunch of carraway
shrub is hanging up to dry. It grows all about
here. The seeds are mixed with all kinds of food.</p>

<p>“Friske smag har det,” remarks the old lady.
“It has a fresh taste with it.”</p>

<p>Outside the house there are two or three lysters,
and some split pine-roots for “burning the water.”
In the dark, still nights of autumn, the trout and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
bleke which approach the shore are speared by the
men.</p>

<p>In the passage is suspended a notice to the
effect that instruction in agriculture is offered by
the Government gratis, at a school down the
valley, to all young men who bring a certificate of
baptism, vaccination, and also a testimonial of
good moral conduct from the clergyman.</p>

<p>While I am reading this notice, a desolate-looking
young female, with dishevelled black hair,
comes staring at me through the open door, with a
most wobegone aspect. Her husband, I find, is
a drinker of brantviin. On one occasion he went
down to Christiansand, drank tremendously, and
returned quite rabid. For some time he was
chained leg to leg. He is better now, but beats
the unfortunate creature, his wife, who does not
complain. I recommended the people, the next
time he did it, to chain him again, and pay the
bully back in some of his own coin&mdash;hard
knocks.</p>

<p>Hearing so much of the trouts of the Högvand,
<i>i.e.</i>, High-water (the people here call it Högvatn, reminding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
me of the Crummack-<i>waters</i>, and Derwent-waters,
of the North of England), I take Tallak,
one of the sons, across the lake. On the further
shore stood a man, with his young wife and child.
They had a small boat, but it could not have
lived in the swell now on the loch; so they
borrowed ours for the transit. Threading our way
through some birch scrub, we emerge upon the old
smelting-house, where the copper-ore brought from
the Valle copper-mine used to be prepared. But
it is now at a stand-still, and the beck close by
rushes down with useless and unemployed energy.
This stream comes down from the lake to which
we are going.</p>

<p>On the way we pass a small shanty, of about
eight feet square. I peep in through the open door.
On the floor sits a young woman, with her three
children. Their sleeping berths are just overhead,
let into the wall. After a stiff ascent, we reach
the High-water. Launched on the lake, I expected
great things, as the rain, which still poured when
we started, had ceased, and a fine ripple curled the
waters, which glistened smilingly as they caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
sight of the sun’s cheerful countenance emerging
from behind the heavy clouds. But my hopes
were doomed to disappointment. Tallak said it
was torden-veir (thunder-weather), and unpropitious.
Nevertheless, a banging fish took one of my flies,
but carried the whole tackle away.</p>

<p>I then tried the triangles, and a four-pounder, at
least, golden and plump, dashed at me, but by a
clever plunge out of his own element, he managed
to get clear again. After this I had not another
chance; but I have no doubt, that if I had given a
day to the lake, instead of an hour or two, I should
have succeeded in developing its capabilities. The
boat, or pram as it is called in these parts, is flat-bottomed
and oblong. The rowing appliances are
very peculiar. Two narrow boards, about three feet
apart, were placed about midships, at right angles to
the boat’s length, and extending over the gunwale
about a foot; two more similar pieces of wood were
laid parallel to each other over the ends of the first
two pieces, to which they were tied by birchen
thongs, so as to form a square framework lying on
the boat’s gunwale. Two thole-pins were stuck into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
each of the side pieces. Here, then, in the mountains
of Thelemarken, we find the original outrigger,
centuries old, the predecessor of the Claspers’
invention, now so commonly used in England.
On one of the cross-boards I sat, on the other the
rower, thus keeping the frame firm by our own
weight, it being secured to the body of the boat by
birch-ties only. There was not a particle of iron
about the whole affair; it was the simplest contrivance
for crossing water I ever saw.</p>

<p>On our walk homeward Tallak tells me that he
has seen the cat-lynx down in the valley, but that
they generally keep up among the broken rocks
(Urden). The wind was now so high that the
passage of the Fjord was somewhat difficult. At
times, I hear, it is so lashed by sudden tempests
from the storm-engendering mountains, that the
water leaves its bed, and fills the air with spray
and foam.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Skomedal, who schusses me up this
evening to Langeid, is a rich man in his
way, owning three farms, not to mention a
quantity of “arvegods” (heirlooms) on his wife’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
side, in the shape of halberds, helmets, swords,
apostle-spoons, and “oldtids aeld-gammle sager”
(ancient curiosities).</p>

<p>He asked if I knew a cure for his gicht
(rheumatism). Many years ago he was at a bryllup
(wedding), when he got fuul (Scoticè fou = drunk);
indeed everybody was fuul. But unfortunately
he got wet outside as well as in, and fell
asleep in his wet clothes, since when he has been
troubled with aching pains.</p>

<p>The bears have killed two of his horses. The
one he is driving he bought out of a drove from
the Hardanger. It is only two years old, and shies
alarmingly in the dusk<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> at some huge stones which
have been placed by the roadside at intervals,
battlement fashion, to keep travellers from going
over the precipice, though the embrasures are like
an act of parliament, and would admit of a coach
and four being driven between them. “I thought
it was a bear,” said Skomedal, as he made out the
stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Becoming quite conversational and familiar, he
offers me a pinch of snuff (snuus), whence the
Scotch, “sneeshing.” It was excellent “high dried,”
and, to my astonishment, of home manufacture, he
buying the tobacco-leaf and the necessary flavouring
fluid at the town. The rain having been very
heavy, the valley is alive with falling waters. We
pass a splendid fall close by the road, the white
rage of which gleamed distinctly through the darkness,
rendering that part of the road lighter than
the rest. Imagine the way being lighted with cascades.
Who would care for a row of gas-lamps
under such circumstances?</p>

<p>This fall, Skomedal tells me, was once drawn by
a Frenchman; but I doubt much one of that
nation ever venturing into these parts. “Well,
Skomedal, can’t you tell me some tales about
the trolls?” said I, thinking the hour and the
scene were admirably adapted for that sort of
amusement.</p>

<p>“Let me see, ah! yes. There was a woman up
at my stöl in Skomedal&mdash;that’s where the tomt
(site) of the old church is to be seen. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
all alone one Thorsdags qveld (Thursday evening),
her companion having come down to the gaard for
mad (food). Looking out she sees what she supposes
is Sigrid coming back up the mountain with
a great box of provisions. But when the figure
gets alongside of an abrupt rock just below, it
suddenly disappears. Gunvor knew then that it
was a Thus.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s all very well to say nonsense, but why
do the cattle always get shy and urolig (unruly),
when they pass that spot. We never could make
out before why this was, but it was plain now, they
could tell by their instinct there was something
uncanny close by.”</p>

<p>“Very good; do you know another tale?” said
I, our pace well admitting of this diversion, as it
was very slow in the dark wood, into which our
road had now entered.</p>

<p>“Yes, that same woman, Gunvor’s husband, was
the best fiddler in the valley. One day, when she
was all alone, she heard near her a beautiful tune
(vaene slot) played on a violin. She could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nobody, though she looked all over. That must
have been a Troll underground. She remembered
the tune, and taught it her husband. It was called
(the name has slipped my recollection.) Nothing
so beautiful as that slot was ever heard in the
valley.</p>

<p>“But he is dead now, and there is nobody who
can play as he did.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>At Langeid station, where we arrived late at night,
there was great difficulty in finding anybody at
home. At last we ferreted out an old man in one
of the multifarious buildings, which, as usual,
formed the establishment. All the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
family are paa hoien (up on the mountain). That
Langeid was a horrid place. As there was no
wash-basin to be found, I laid hands upon a quaint
brass mortar, which the old man informed me was
“manifold hundred years old.” In the travellers’
book I see a German has been informing the people
that he is a Ph.D. But then I have seen elsewhere,
in this country, an Englishman’s name in
the book with M.P. attached to it. But he went
down, poor man, with the steamer <i>Ercolano</i>, so we
must leave him alone.</p>

<p>What a lovely morning after the rain. The
spines of the fir-trees, and the hairy lichen (<i>alectoria
jubata</i>) festooning the branches, frosted over
with the moisture which still adheres to them, and
is not yet sucked up by the sun that is just rising
over the high mountains. What refreshing odours
they shed abroad, seconded by the lowlier “pors,”
with its delicious aromatic perfume.</p>

<p>What an intense pleasure it is thus to travel
through an unknown country, not knowing where
one is to be at the day’s end, and looking at the
map to find out where in the world one is. Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
me this rather than a journey in Switzerland, and
all the first-rate hotels in the world.</p>

<p>“Up yonder,” said my attendant, “a bear used
to harbour. The man in the gaard above shot
him not long ago. He was very large. That’s a
‘Vitr’ (warning) yonder, on the top of that
mountain to the east. There are a great many
dozen of pine-logs piled up there from the olden
times.”</p>

<p>I discovered that this was a beacon-hill, formerly
used to give notice of the approach of foes on the
coast. The next beacon was at Lobdal, a great
many miles down the valley. The establishment
of beacons from Naes to Helgeland, is attributed,
by Snorro, to Hacon the Good. A slower way of
conveying intelligence of the descent of an enemy
on the coast, was the split arrow (haeror), equivalent
to the fiery cross of Scotland.</p>

<p>“Are not you frightened to travel all alone?”
said the little fellow, looking curiously into my
face. “You might be injured.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” replied I.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, we Norwegians are good people, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in Hallingdal&mdash;they are rare rough fellows
there, terrible fighters.”</p>

<p>To the left of the road, high on the hill, is the
abode of Herjus, the bear-victim mentioned above,
who is gradually recovering from his wounds.</p>

<p>The scenery becomes grander as we advance.
What would you think of trees growing on the
side of a precipice, apparently as steep as Flamboro’
Head, and ten times as high? They seem
determined to get into places where the axe cannot
reach them. But they are not safe for all that.
Now and then the mountain side will crack, and
some of it comes down. Look at that vast stone,
which would throw all your Borrowdale boulder
stones into the shade; it has come down in this
manner. Advantage has been taken of its overhanging
top to stow away under it a lot of agricultural
instruments, among which I see a primitive
harrow of wood.</p>

<p>At Ryssestad station I find a quaint old powder-horn,
more than two hundred years old, on which
Daniel in the lion’s den, Roland, Adam and Eve,
Samson and Delilah, figure in marvellous guise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I note this, as I afterwards saw almost the facsimile
of it in the Bergen Museum. The owners
declined to part with it.</p>

<p>There was also a wolf’s skin, price five dollars.
The station-master shot him from one of the windows
last winter, while prowling about the premises.
One Sigur Sannes offers for sale a curious
old “hand-axe,” date 1622, but I did not wish to
add to my luggage.</p>

<p>What a set of giants surrounded me while I
was drinking coffee! and such names&mdash;Bjug,
Salvi, Jermund, Gundar! Imagine all these long-legged
fellows standing in trousers reaching to
their very shoulders and neck, and supported by
shoulder-straps decked in brass ornaments, while
below they are secured by nine buttons above the
ankle. What may be seen of their shirts is confined
by two immense silver bullet studs, and then
a silver brooch an inch and a half wide. The hats,
of felt, are made in the valley. The brim is very
small, and the crown narrows half way up, and
then swells out again. A silver chain is passed
round it two or three times, and confined in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
by a broad silver clasp, to which is suspended a
cross. A figured velvet band likewise goes twice
round it.</p>

<p>The dress of the women is the black or white
skirt, already mentioned, swelling into enormous
folds behind, and so short as to permit the garters
with silver clasps to be seen. The stockings
bulge out immensely at the calf&mdash;indeed, are
much fuller than is necessary&mdash;giving the legs a
most plethoric appearance, and, as in the Tyrol,
they often only reach to the ankle. Occasionally,
when the women wish to look very smart, a pair
of white socks are drawn over the foot, which
oddly contrasts with the black stocking. The
shoes, which are home-made, are pointed, and fit
remarkably well. On the bosom is a saucer-sized
brooch of silver, besides bullet-studs at the collar
and wristband. I see also women carrying their
babies in the kjell or plaid.</p>

<p>Beyond the station, we have to diverge from
the regular road, and take an improvised one, the
bridge having been carried away by a flom (freshet).
At a ferry above, where the river opens into a lake,
the ferrywoman, after presenting to me her mull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of home-made snuff, inquires if I am married.
This provokes a similar query from me.</p>

<p>“No,” is the reply; “but I have a grown-up
son.”</p>

<p>The custom of Nattefrieri, to which I have
alluded elsewhere, will account for things of this
kind.</p>

<p>Beyond the ferry there has been a recent fall of
rocks from the cliffs above. In the cool recesses
of the rocks grow numbers of strawberries and
raspberries, which my man obligingly gathers and
presents to me. A black and white woodpecker,
with red head and rump, perches on a pine-tree
close by.</p>

<p>A little above is the finest fall on the river,
except that near Vigeland. All around the smooth
scarped cliffs converge down to the water at a
considerable angle, the cleavage being parallel to
their surface.</p>

<p>At one spot my chatty little post-boy, who, boy
as he was, rejoiced in a wife and child, stops to
talk with a mighty tall fellow, one Björn
Tvester, who offers to take me up some high
mountain near to see a fine view. A woman close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
by, who is unfortunately absent on the hills, possesses
an ancient silver cross, of great size and
fine workmanship. This used, in former times, to
be used by the bridegroom at a wedding.</p>

<p>A smiling plain now opens before us, in the
centre of which stands the parish church. While
I stop to enjoy the prospect, a crowd of men and
women collect around me. One of the fair sex, who
rejoiced in the name of Mari Björnsdatter, I endeavour
to sketch, to her great delight.</p>

<p>“Stor mirakel!” (great miracle) shouted the
peasants, looking over my shoulder. “Aldrig
seet maken<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (never saw the like)”!</p>

<p>“And what’s your name?” I asked of a red-headed
urchin, of miserable appearance. The
answer, “Thor,” made me smile, and produced a
roar from the masculines, Folke, Orm, Od (a
very odd name, indeed), Dreng, Sigbjörn, and a
titter from the feminines ditto, all of whom saw
the joke at once.</p>

<p>Putting up at the station-master’s at Rige, I
sally out and meet with an intelligent fellow,
Arne Bjugson by name, formerly a schoolmaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
now a pedlar. He tells me there is an ancient
bridal dress at one of the houses, and he it was
who put this on, and sat to Tidemann for his
sketch of the Sætersdal Bridegroom.</p>

<p>We forthwith go to inspect it. The bridegroom’s
jacket is of blue, over which came
another of red. His knee-breeches are black, and
crimped or plaited; his blue stockings were
wound round with ribands; his hat was swathed
in a white cloth, round which a silver chain was
twisted. In his hand he held a naked sword;
around his waist was a brass belt, and on his neck a
silver chain with medals. The bride’s dress consisted
of two black woollen petticoats, plaited or
folded; above these a blue one, and over all a red
one. Then came a black apron, and above that a
white linen one, and round her waist three silver
belts. Her jacket was black, with a small red
collar, ornamented with a profusion of buckles,
hooks, fibulas, and chains. On her head was a
silver-gilt crown, and around her neck a pearl
necklace, to which a medal, called “Agnus Dei,”
was suspended.</p>

<p>Arne has read <i>Snorro’s Chronicle</i>, which he borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
from the parson. Ivar Aasen, the author
of several works on the old Norsk language, has
been more than once up here examining into the
dialect. Those interested in the sources of the
English language, and in ascertaining how much
of it is due to the old Norsk, have ample room
for amusement and instruction here. Many English
words, unknown in the modern Norwegian,
are to be found in use in these secluded parts,
though driven from the rest of the country, just
in the same way as the Norsk language was talked
at Bayeux a long time after it had become obsolete
at Rouen and other parts of Normandy. Our
“noon” reappears in “noni;” “game,” in “gama,”
a word not known away from this. “To prate,”
is “prata;” “to die,” is “doi;” “two,” is “twi,”
not “to,” as elsewhere; indeed, all the numerals
differ from those used elsewhere. The people
pronounce “way,” “plough,” and “net,” just
like an Englishman. To “neigh,” is “neja,”
not “vrinska.” A stocking is “sock,” not
“strömpe;” eg = edge; skafe = safe or cupboard;
“kvik” corresponds in all its meanings to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
word “quick.” The old Icelandic “gildr” is used
as an eulogistic epithet, = excellent. Their word
for “wheel” sounds like our English, and is not
“eule,” as elsewhere; “stubbe” is our “stub,” or
little bit; “I” is “oi,” not “Ieg;” “fir” is pronounced
“fir;” “spon” has been already mentioned:
“snow,” “mile,” “cross,” re-occur here,
whereas elsewhere they differ from the English.</p>

<p>While we are engaged in these philological
lucubrations a man comes up, a piece of whose
lower-lip has gone, interfering with his speech.
This occurred at a wedding. He and another
had a trial of strength, in which he proved the
strongest. The vanquished man, assisted by his
two brothers, then set upon him, and bit him like
a dog. As aforesaid, the people of the valley are
ordinarily good-natured and peaceable enough; but
let them only get at the ale or brandy, and they
become horribly brutal and ferocious, and a
slagsmal (fight) is sure to ensue. One method of
attack on these occasions is by gouging the eye
out, spone i ovgo (literally to spoon out the eye).
Sometimes the combatants place some hard substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in the hand, as a stone or piece of wood.
This they call “a hand-devil,” the “knuckle-duster”
of English ruffians. At Omlid, several
miles over the mountains to the east of this, the
people even when sober are said to be anything
but snil (good). So disastrous was the effect of
drink at a bridal (<i>i.e.</i>, bride-ale or wedding festival),<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
that the bride, it is said, frequently used
to bring with her a funeral shirt for fear that she
might have to carry home her husband dead. In
any case she was provided with bandages wherewith
to dress his wounds.</p>

<p>I picked up another very intelligent Cicerone in
Mr. Sunsdal, the Lehnsman of the district.</p>

<p>“You would, perhaps, like to see one of the old
original dwellings of our forefathers,” said he;
“there are still many of them in this part of
Norway. The name is Rogstue, <i>i.e.</i>, smoke-room.”</p>

<p>We accordingly entered one of these pristine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
abodes, such as were the fashion among the highest
of the land many hundred years ago. The house
was built of great logs, and its chief and almost
only sitting-room had no windows, the light being
admitted from above by an orifice (ljaaren) in the
centre of the roof, over which fitted a lid fastened
to a pole. Through this the smoke escaped from
the great square fireplace (aaren) in the middle of
the floor, enclosed by hewn stones. Round this
ran heavy benches, the backs of which were carved
with various devices. A huge wooden crane, rudely
carved into the figure of a head, and blackened
with smoke, projected from a side wall to a point
half-way between the hearth and chimney-hole.
From this the great porridge-pot (Gryd-hodden)
was suspended. Kettle is “hodden” in old English.</p>

<p>On this smoke-blackened crane I discerned two
or three deep scars, indicative of a custom now
obsolete. On the occasion of a wedding, the
bridegroom used to strike his axe into this as
he entered, which was as much as to say that peace
should be the order of the day; an omen, be it
said, which seldom came true in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>One side of this pristine apartment was taken up
by the two beds (kvillunne) fixed against the
wall, according to the custom of the country, and
in shape resembling the berths on board ship.
Between them was the safe or cupboard (skape).
On the opposite side of the wall was a wooden
dresser of massive workmanship, while round
the room were shelves with cheeses upon them.
They were placed just within the smoke line, as
I shall call it. The smoke, in fact, not having
draught enough, descends about half-way down
the walls, rendering that portion of them which
came within the lowest smoke-mark of the sooty
vapour as black as the fifty wives of the King
of the Cannibal Islands; while the great beams
below this preserved their original wood colour.</p>

<p>The lady of the house, Sigrid Halvorsdatter,
took a particular pride in showing the interior of
her abode. Good-nature was written on her physiognomy,
and the writing was not counterfeit.
When we arrived, she was just on the point of
going up the mountain with a light wooden-frame
(meiss) on her shoulders, on which was bound a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
heavy milk-pail; but she immediately deposited
her burden on a great stone at the door, took a
piece of wood from under the eaves and unfastened
the door. Subsequently, I find that this is the
identical dame, and Rogstue, painted by Tidemann,
and published among his illustrations of
Norwegian customs.</p>

<p>Taking leave of her with many thanks, we
proceeded to another house, where the woman said
we should see a “Simon Svipu.”</p>

<p>“A Simon Svipu!” ejaculates the reader, “what
on earth is that?” Thereby hangs a tale, or a
tail, if you will. The nightmare plagued these
people before she visited England.</p>

<p>The people of this valley call her “Muro,” and
they have the following effectual remedy against
her. They first take a knife, wrap it up in a
kerchief, and pass it three times round the body;
a pair of scissors are also called into requisition,
and, lastly, a “Simon Svipu,” which is the
clump or excrescence found on the branches of
the birch-tree, and out of which grow a number
of small twigs. This last is hung up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stable over the horses’ heads, or fixed in one of
the rafters, and also over their own bed.</p>

<p>This exorcism is then pronounced&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Muro, Muro, cursed jade,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">If you’re in, then you must out;</div>
<div class="verse">Here are Simon Svipu, scissors, blade,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Will put you to the right about.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The birchen charm may remind one of the
slips of yew “shivered in the moon’s eclipse,” in
<i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>The term “svipu” is used in parts of the country
for whip, instead of the real word “svöbe.”
And I have no doubt this is the signification
of it here&mdash;viz., a means of driving away the
mare.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>But to return to the real Simon Pure&mdash;I mean
Svipu. Unfortunately, I could not get a sight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it. The good folks either could not, or would not,
find the wonderful instrument. I believe, though
still in their heart clinging to the ancient superstition,
they were averse to confessing it to
others.</p>

<p>“But here comes a man,” said the Lehnsman,
“who will tell us some curious anecdotes; his
name is Solomon Larsen Haugebirke. He is
a silversmith and blacksmith by trade, and having
been servant to half-a-dozen priests here, he has
become waked up, and having a tenacious memory,
he can throw a good deal of light on the ancient
customs of the valley. Gesegnet arbeid (blessed
labour) to you, Solomon.”</p>

<p>“Good day, Mr. Lehnsman. You have got
a stranger with you, I see. Is he a Tüsker
(German)?”</p>

<p>The old gentleman was soon down on the grass,
under the shadow of an outbuilding, the sun being
intensely hot, and whiffing his pipe, stopped with
my tobacco, while he folded his hands in deep
thought.</p>

<p>“Well, really, Lehnsman, I can’t mind anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
just on the moment. Landstad and Bugge<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
were both here, and got all my stories and songs.”</p>

<p>“But can’t you remember something about
Aasgardsreia?”</p>

<p>After pausing for a minute or two, Solomon
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, sir, you know it was always about Yule-tide,
when we were just laid down in bed, that
they came by. They never halted till they came
to a house where something was going to happen.
They used to stop at the door, and dash their
saddles against the wall or roof, making the
whole house shake, and the great iron pot rattle
again.”</p>

<p>“But do you really believe in it, Solomon?”
said I, putting some more tobacco in his pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I was a lad I did, but now I don’t
think I do. Still there was something very strange
about it, wasn’t there, sir? The horses in the
stable used to be all of a sweat, as if they heard
the noise, and were frightened. <i>They</i> could not
have fancied it, whatever <i>we</i> did.”</p>

<p>“But are you certain they did sweat?”</p>

<p>“I believe you; I’ve gone into the stable, and
found them as wet as if they had been dragged
through the river.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>“Ah! but I can easily explain that,” said the
Lehnsman. “When I first came here, some years
ago, the young men were a very lawless lot; they
thought nothing of taking the neighbours’ horses
at night, and riding them about the country,
visiting the jenter (girls); and it is my firm belief
that they took advantage of the old superstition
about the Aasgaardsreia coming by, and making
the horses sweat, to carry on their own frolic with
impunity. It was they that made the horses sweat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
by bringing them back all of a heat, and not
these sprites that you talk of.”</p>

<p>I felt inclined to take the Lehnsman’s view
of the case; but the old man shook his head
doubtingly.</p>

<p>“Ride, sir! why, at the time I speak of, you
could not possibly ride, the snow was so deep that
the roads were impassable. But now we are
talking about it, it strikes me there may have
been another cause. The horses used to get so
much extra food just then, in honour of Yule,
and the stalls are so small and close, that perhaps
it made them break out in a sweat. Be that as it
may, we used all to be terribly frightened when
we heard the Aasgaardsreia.”</p>

<p>“It was merely the rush of the night wind,” said
I, “beating against the house sides.”</p>

<p>“Would the night wind carry people clean
away?” rejoined Solomon, returning to the charge.
“Once, when they came riding by, there was a
woman living at that gaard yonder, who fell into
a besvömmelse (swoon); and in that state she
was carried along with them right away to Toftelien,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
five old miles to the eastward.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And more
by token, though she had never been there before,
she gave a most accurate description of the place.
I was by, and heard her. What do you think of
that, Herr Lehnsman?” concluded Solomon, who
was evidently halting between two antagonistic
feelings, his superior enlightenment and his old
deep-rooted boyish superstitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe it at all,” was the incredulous
functionary’s reply; “it was, no doubt, the power
of imagination, and the woman had heard from
somebody, though she might have forgotten it,
what Toftelien looked like.”</p>

<p>“You talked about the night-wind,” continued
Solomon, turning to me. “I remember well when
I was a lad, if there was a virvel-vind (whirlwind),
I used to throw my toll-knife right into it. We
all believed that it was the sprites that caused
it, and that we should break the charm in that
way.”</p>

<p>“Of course you believed in the underground
people generally?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, we did. I know a man up yonder,
at Bykle, who, whenever he went up to the Stöl,
used, directly he got there, and had opened the
door, to kneel down, and pray them not to disturb
him for four weeks; and afterwards they might
come to the place, and welcome, till the next
summer.”</p>

<p>“But did you ever see any of these people?”
said I, resolved on probing Solomon with a home
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I’ve never <i>seen</i> them, but I have heard
them, as sure as I sit on this stone.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, and how was that?”</p>

<p>“Well, you must know, I was up in the Fjeld
to the eastward at a fiskevatn (lake with fish in).
Suddenly I heard a noise close by me, just behind
some rocks, and I thought it was other folks come
up to fish. They were talking very loudly and
merrily; so I called out to let them know I was
there, as I wished to have selskab (company).
Directly I called, it was all still. This puzzled
me; so I went round the rocks, but not a creature
could I see, so I returned to my fishing. Presently
the noise began again, and I distinctly heard folks
talking.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of talk was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! baade fiint o gruft (both fine and coarse,
<i>i.e.</i>, good and bad words), accuratè som paa en
bryllup (just like at a wedding). I called out
again, on which the noise suddenly stopped. Presently
they began afresh, and I could make out it
was folks dancing. Then I felt convinced that it
must be a thuss<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>-bryllup (elf-wedding).”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Had you slept well the night before?”</p>

<p>“Never better.”</p>

<p>“You had been drinking, then?”</p>

<p>“Langt ifra (far from it); I was as ædru (sober)
and clear-headed as a man could be who had taken
nothing but coffee and milk for weeks.”</p>

<p>“And how long did this noise continue?”</p>

<p>“Two hours at least. Every time I cried out
they stopped, and after a space began again. I
examined all around very carefully, as I was not a
bit afraid; but I could see no hole or anything,
nothing but bare rocks. Now what could it be?”
asked the old man, solemnly.</p>

<p>There are more things in heaven and earth,
thought I, than we dream of.</p>

<p>“Besides,” continued Solomon, “there was
another man I afterwards found fishing at another
part of the water, who heard the same noise.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” said the Lehnsman.</p>

<p>“Olsen Prestergaard,” (<i>i.e.</i>, Olsen Parsonage, so
called because he was born on the parsonage
farm).</p>

<p>“But he is as deaf as a post,” retorted the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is <i>now</i>, but he was not then. He has been
deaf only since he got that cold five years ago;
and this that I am talking of happened six, come
Martinsmass.”</p>

<p>It may be as well to state that we met Mr.
Parsonage subsequently making hay, and, after a
vast deal of hammering, he was made to understand
us, when, with a most earnest expression
of countenance he confirmed Solomon’s account
exactly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell us some more of your tales?”
said the Lehnsman; “one of those will do you told
to Landstad and Moe, or to Bugge last summer.”</p>

<p>“How long does the stranger stop?” asked
Solomon; “I will endeavour to recollect one or
two.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I shall be off to-morrow,” said I.</p>

<p>“Why so early? Well, let me see. There was
the grey fole (horse) at Roysland. I’ll tell you
about that. You must know, then, sir, we used
many years ago to have a horse-race (skei) on the
flat, just beyond the church yonder, at the end of
August-month each year. There was a man living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
up at Roysland, an old mile from here, up on the
north side of the Elv. He was a strange sort of a
fellow, nobody could make him out; Laiv Roysland,
they called him. One August, on the morning
of the race, a grey horse came down to his
gaard and neighed. He went and put the halter on
him, and seeing he was a likely sort of a nag,
thought he would take him down and run him,
without asking anybody any questions. And sure
enough he came. The horse&mdash;he was a stallion&mdash;beat
all the rest easily. Laiv carried off all the
prizes and returned home. When he got there he
let the horse loose, and it immediately took up to
the hills, and was not heard of or seen for twelve
months. When the race-day came round, a neigh
was heard (han nejade), Laiv went out of the door,
and found the same horse. He put the halter on
his head, and brought him down to the races just
as before. He won everything. There never was
the likes of him whether in biting or running
(bitast eller springast). He was always the best.
At last people began to talk, and said it must be
the fand sjel (the fiend himself). The third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
year the horse ran it lost. What a rage Laiv
was in. When he got home he hit the horse a
tremendous thwack with his whip, and cursed a
loud oath. It struck out, and killed him on the
spot. Next year a neigh was heard as usual outside
the house, early on the morning of the race-day,
but nobody dared go out. They were not
such dare-devils as Laiv. It neighed a second
time, but the people would not venture, and from
that time to this it has never been heard of or
seen.”</p>

<p>“A strange wild tale,” said I; “ what do you
really think it was?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it was <i>He</i>. I never told that
story,” continued Solomon, “to any one before.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there can be no doubt about it,” said
Solomon, after a long pause; “so many people
have seen these underground people that there
must be some truth in it. Besides which, is not
there something about it in Holy Writ: ‘Every
knee shall bow, both of things that are in heaven,
and in earth, and under the earth,’ and who can
be under the earth but the underground people?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Solomon, have you no more tales?”</p>

<p>“Not of the valley here, but I can tell you one
of the country up north.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that will do.”</p>

<p>“Well, you must know, there was a man at a
gaard up there&mdash;let me see, I can’t rightly mind
the name of it. He was good friends with a Tuss;
used, in fact, to worship him (dyrkes). The priest
got to hear of this, and warned him that it was
wrong. The man made no secret of the fact, but
persisted that there was no harm in it. Indeed, he
derived a mint of good from the acquaintance.
His crops were a vast deal finer, and he really could
not give up his friend on any consideration.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
man spoke with such apparent earnestness and conviction,
that the priest was seized with a desire to
see the Tuss. ‘That you shall, and welcome,’ said
the man; ‘I don’t anticipate any difficulty. I’ve
lent him two rolls of chew-tobacco, and he will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sure to return them before long. No Christian
can be more punctual than he is in matters of
business.’ The little gentleman put in an appearance
soon after, and honestly repaid the tobacco,
with thanks for the loan of it (tak for laane).
‘Bide a bit, my friend,’ said the farmer, ‘our parson
wants to have a snak (chat) with you.’ ‘Impossible,’
he replied; ‘I’ve no time; but I’ve a
brother that’s a parson. He’s just the man; besides,
he has more time than me. I’ll send him.’
The tuss-priest accordingly came, and had a long
dispute with the priest of this world about various
passages in the Bible. The latter was but a poor
scholar, so he was easily out-argued.</p>

<p>“At last they began to dispute about vor Frelser
(our Redeemer).</p>

<p>“‘Frelser!’ exclaimed the goblin-priest, ‘I want
no Frelser.’</p>

<p>“‘How so?’</p>

<p>“‘I’m descended from Adam’s first wife. When
she brought forth the child from which our people
trace their descent, Adam had not sinned.’</p>

<p>“‘First wife?’ repeated the University man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
‘where do you find anything about first wife in
the five books of Moses? If you have found any
such like thing there, you have not read it right,’
said he.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you remember,’ said the tuss, ‘the
Bible has it, “This is <i>now</i> bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh.” So he must have been
married before to somebody of a different nature.’</p>

<p>“The other, who was not so well read in the
Bible as he ought to be&mdash;so much of his time was
taken up in farming and such like unaandelig (un-spiritual)
occupations&mdash;was not able to confute
this argument. Indeed, the tuss-priest beat the
Lutheran priest hollow in every argument, till at
last they parted, and the latter was never known
again to express a wish to have any further controversy
with so subtle an antagonist.”</p>

<p>It is well known that some of the old English and
Border ballads, <i>e.g.</i>, “King Henrie,” “Kempion,”
“the Douglas Tragedy,” the “Dæmon Lover,” are,
more or less Scandinavian in their origin. In the
same way, “Jack the Giant Killer,” and “Thomas
Thumb,” derive many of their features from the
Northern Pantheon.</p>

<p>Mr. Halliwell, in his <i>Nursery Rhymes of England</i>,
and <i>Popular Rhymes</i>, quotes some Swedish
facsimiles of our rhymes of this class, and states,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
further, on the authority of Mr. Stephens, that the
English infants of the nineteenth century “have
not deserted the rhymes chanted so many ages
since by their mothers in the North.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It struck
me, therefore, that in this store-house of antiquities,
Sætersdal, I might be able to pick up some information
corroborative of the above hypothesis. It
was some time, however, before I could make Solomon
understand what I meant by nursery rhymes.
At last he hit upon my meaning, and I discovered
that the word here for a lullaby or jingle, is
“börne-süd.” Elsewhere, it is called Tull, or
Lull-börn, whence our Lullaby.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of such things?” said Solomon;
“they are pure nonsense.”</p>

<p>But, on my entreaty, he and others recited a few,
in a sort of simple chant. The reader acquainted
with that species of literature in England will be
able to trace some resemblance between it and the
following specimens, which have been in vogue in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
this out-of-the-way valley several hundred years.
The oldest people in it have inherited the same from
their forefathers, and they are in the old dialect,
which is, in a great measure, the old Norse. While
what is very remarkable, like as is the case with us
and our nursery rhymes, the people in many cases
recited to me what appeared sheer nonsense, the
meaning of which they were themselves unable to
explain.</p>

<p>It being now noon (noni), or Solomon’s meal-time,
he left me, promising to give me a call in
the evening.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you must take a glass of finkel
with me; it will refresh your mind as well as
body.”</p>

<p>“Not a drop, thank you. If I begin, I can’t
stop.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way with these bonders,” observed
the Lehnsman to me, when we were alone; “even
the most intelligent of them, if they once get hold
of the liquor, go on drinking till they are furiously
drunk.”</p>

<p>This then is pre-eminently the country for
Father Mathews!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“By-the-bye,” said the Lehnsman, “our parson
has left us, and his successor is not yet arrived;
but I think I can get the keys from the clerk, and
we will go to the vicarage, and look at the kald-bog
(call-book), a sort of record of all the notable
things that have ever happened at the kald
(living).”</p>

<p>Presently we found ourselves seated in the
priest’s chamber, with the said book before us.</p>

<p>The following curious reminiscence of the
second priest after the Reformation is interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One Sunday, when the priest was just going
up into the pulpit (praeke-stol), in strode the
Lehnsman Wund (or ond = bad, violent), Osmund
Berge. He had on a pair of new boots, which
creaked a good deal, much to the scandal of the
congregation, who looked upon this sort of foot-covering
as an abomination; shoes being the only
wear of the valley. The priest, who had a private
feud with Osmund, foolishly determined to take
the opportunity of telling him a little bit of his
mind, and spoke out strongly on the impropriety
of his coming in so late, and with creaking boots,
forsooth. Bad Osmund sat down, gulping in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
wrath, but when the sermon was ended, he waited
at the door till the priest came out of church, and
in revenge struck him with his knife, <i>after the
custom of those days</i>. The priest fell dead, and
the congregation, in great wrath at the death of
their pastor, set upon the murderer, stoned
him to death a few steps from the church, and
buried him where he fell. Until a few years
ago, a cairn of stones, the very implements,
perhaps, of his lapidation, marked the spot of his
interment. After this tragical occurrence, the
parish was without a clergyman for three years;
till at last another pastor was introduced by a
rich man of those parts, on the promise of the
parishioners that he should be protected from
harm.”</p>

<p>I found, in the same book, a curious notice of
one Erik Leganger, another clergyman. When
he came to the parish, not a person in it could
read or write. By his unremitting endeavours he
wrought a great change in this respect, and the
people progressed in wisdom and knowledge. This
drew upon him the animosity of the Father of Evil
himself. On one occasion, when the priest was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
sledging to his other church, the foul fiend met
him in the way; a dire contest ensued, which
ended in the man of God overpowering his
adversary, whom he treated like the witch
Sycorax did Ariel, confining him “into a cloven
pine.”</p>

<p>A later annotator on this notable entry says,
the only way of explaining this affair is by the
fact that the priest, although a good man, had a
screw loose in his head (skrue los i Hovedet).
But this Judæus Apella ought to have remembered
the case of Doctor Luther, not to mention Saint
Dunstan.</p>

<p>The good Lehnsman, who entered with great
enthusiasm into my desire for information on all
subjects, now commenced reading an entry made by
a former priest, with whom he had been acquainted,
of his daily going out and coming in
during the period it had pleased God to set him
over that parish, with notices of his previous
history. His father had been drowned while he
was a child, and his widowed mother was left with
three children, whom she brought up with great
difficulty, owing to her narrow means. Being put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to school, he attracted the notice of the master,
who encouraged him to persevere in his studies.
Finally, by the assistance of friends, he got to
the University, earning money for the purpose by
acting as tutor in private families during the vacations.
At last he passed his theological examination,
but only as “baud illaudabilis;” the reason
for which meagre commendation he attributes to
his time being so taken up with private tuition.
At the practical examination he came out “laudabilis,”
so that he had retrieved his position. He
then mentions how that he was married to the
betrothed of his boyhood and became a curate;
till at length he was promoted to this place, which
he had now left for better preferment, expressing
the hope, in his own hand-writing, “that he had
worked among his people not without profit.
Amen.”</p>

<p>At this moment, the good Lehnsman&mdash;whether
it was that the heat or his fatigue in my behalf
was too much for him, or whether it was that he
was overcome by the simple and feeling record of
his former pastor’s early struggles&mdash;turned pale,
and became deadly sick. Eventually he recovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and, in his politeness, sat down to dinner with me
in his own house.</p>

<p>In the evening I took my fly-rod, and went down
to the river with a retinue of forty rustics at my
heels. The flies, however, having caught hold of
one boy’s cap, nearly breaking my rod, the crowd
were alarmed for their eyes, and kept a respectful
distance, while I pulled out a few trout; an
exploit which drew from them many expressions
of by no means mute wonder.</p>

<p>After this I sat down on a stone, and had a chat
with these fellows. They had evidently got over
the feeling so common among the peasantry of
being afraid at being laughed at by the stranger
and by each other. Many of them blurted out
something. Riddles (Gaator or Gaade, allied to
our word “guess,”) were all the go. These are a
very ancient national pastime. They were, however,
of no great merit. Here are specimens:&mdash;</p>

<p>Much of what they said was spoken in an outlandish
dialect, and what made it worse, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
asked for an explanation, they all cried out together,
like the boys in a Government school in
India. Indeed, when they were once fairly afloat
it was difficult to curb the general excitement.</p>

<p>Moe, a Norwegian writer, who has penetrated
into many of the out-of-the-way valleys of this part
of the country and Thelemarken, states that the
peasants are provided with a large budget of traditional
melodies; but more than this, these genuine
and only representatives of the ancient “smoothers
and polishers of language” (scalds), not only use
the very strophe of those ancient improvisatores,
but have also a knack of improvising songs on
the spur of the moment, or, at all events, of grafting
bits of local colouring into old catches.</p>

<p>The peasants around tipped me one or two of
these staves. When the company are all assembled,
one sings a verse, and challenging another to
contend with him in song, another answers, and,
after a few alternate verses, the two voices chime
in together. What I heard was not extempore,
but traditional in the valley.</p>

<p>One young fellow commenced a stave which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
seemed to be a great favourite, for directly he
began it, the others said, “To be sure, we all know
that; sing it, Thorkil.”</p>

<p>In the evening, true to his promise, old Solomon
appeared. He had called to mind a tale that would
perhaps please me.</p>

<p>“There was once on a time a shooter looking
for fowl on the heights (heio) above Sætersdal.
Well, on he went, doing nothing but looking up
into the tree-tops for the fowl, when, all of a
sudden, he found himself in a house he had never
seen before. There were large chambers all round,
and long corridors, and so many doors he could
not number them. He went seeking about all
over till he was tired. Folk he could see none,
nor could he find his way out. At last he came
to one chamber where he thought he could hear
people, so he opened the door and looked in;
and there sat a lassie alone (eisemo); so he spoke
to her, and asked who lived there. So she
answered they were Tuss folk, and that the house
was so placed that nobody could see it till they
got into it, and then one could not get out again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
‘That’s the way it went with me,’ said she, mournfully;
‘I have been here a long time now, but
don’t think I shall ever get out again.’ The
shooter on this got very frightened, and asked her
if she could not tell him some way of escape.
‘Well,’ answered the girl, ‘I’ll tell you how you
can do it, but you must first promise me to come
back to the gaard and take me away.’ This he
promised at once to do without fail. ‘Now, then,
follow me, and open the door I point out. They
are sitting at the board and eating (aa eta), and
he who sits at the top is the king, and he’s bigger
and brawer than all the others, so that you’ll
know him directly. You must take your rifle, and
aim at the king&mdash;only aim, you mustn’t shoot.
They’ll be in such a fright they’ll drive you out
directly you heave up the gun; so you’ll be all
safe, and then you must think of me. You must
come here next Thursday evening<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> as ever is,
and the next, and the third; and then I’ll follow
you home&mdash;of that you may be certain.’ So she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
went and showed him the door, and he opened
it and went in, and saw them all eating and
drinking, and he up with his gun and pointed it
at the one at the top of the table. Up they all
jumped in alarm; he sprung out, they after him,
and so he got clean out and safe home. On the
first Thursday evening away he went to the Fell,
and the second, and talked each time with the
girl; but the third Thursday, on which all depended,
he didn’t come. I don’t know why it was
he did not keep his promise. Perhaps he thought
if he took her home he should have to marry her.
Anyhow it was base ingratitude. Some three
or four years after the shooter was on the heights
again, when he heard a girl’s voice greet (gret),
and lament that she was so dowie (dauv) and
lonely, and could not get away to her home. He
knew the voice at once&mdash;it was the girl he had
deserted. He looked round and round, and about
on all sides, but could see nothing but rocks and
trees, and so nothing could be done for the poor
lassie.”</p>

<p>“Now I think of it,” continued Solomon, “there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
is a tuss story I’ve heard about this Rigegaard
where you are stopping.”</p>

<p>“Delightful!” thought I; “I never did yet
sleep in a haunted house&mdash;it will be a capital
adventure for the journal.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long time ago since, though. The ‘hill-folks’
used to come and take up their quarters here
at Yule. It was every Yule the same; they never
missed. They did keep it up, I believe you, in
grand style, eating, and drinking, and clattering
till they made the old house ring again. At last,
Arne&mdash;he lived here in those days&mdash;gave the
underground people notice to quit; he would not
put up with it any longer. So off they went. In
the hurry of departure they left some of their
chattels, and, among others, a little copper horse,
which Arne put out of sight, though he had no
idea what it was used for. Next day, a Troll
came down from the hill above yonder, into which
the whole pack had retired for the present, and
claimed the property. Arne, however, had taken
a fancy to the horse, and would not give it up.
They might have that little drinking-beaker of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
strange workmanship, but the copper horse he
was determined to keep. ‘Well,’ said the Troll,
‘keep it then; but, mind this, never you part with
it. If ever you do, this house will never be free
from poverty and bad luck to the end of the present
race.’<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> ‘Good!’ replied Arne, ‘I’ll take care
of that, and my son will keep the horse after
me, and hand it down as an heir-loom.’</p>

<p>“After this, the house went on prosperously,
and no more was heard of the Trolls. Many years
after, when Arne and his son were dead, the grandson
parted with the horse. He had heard of the
story, but he did not care; he did not want such
trash&mdash;not he. After this, nothing went well with
him. Poverty overtook him, and the family fell
into the utmost distress.”</p>

<p>“But,” interposed I, “the people seem very
well-to-do. I see no symptoms of poverty. The
woman is a filthy creature, and that towel is disgusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
[all travellers in Norway, mind and take a
towel with you], and the food she gives me is
uneatable; but I hear they are rich.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Solomon, “but this is quite another
branch of the family. The other one died quite out,
and then the destiny altered. The present people
have risen again in the world.”</p>

<p>Talking of heirlooms, there is no copper horse
now, of course, but there are several quaint things
about the gaard, mementos of ancient days. Among
the rest were two curious old hand-axes, used, as
above-mentioned, by the Norwegians as walking
sticks, when not applied to more desperate service,
the iron being then used as a handle. The door-jambs
of an out-house, moreover, are of singularly
beautiful carving. These are a couple of feet in
width, and formerly adorned the entrance to the
old church of Hyllenstad, and give an idea of the
great taste displayed by these people in ecclesiastical
ornament in the Roman Catholic days. A
tale is told here in wood, which I could not make
out. It is most likely connected with the building
of the church. Sundry figures appear with bellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and hammers, and the implements of the carpenter.
But these are afterwards exchanged for weapons of
a more deadly nature. A man with a sword drives
it right through another, while on the corresponding
jamb a gentleman is seen in hot contest with
a dragon, whose tail is artfully mingled with the
arabesques around. All these figures are carved
in bold relief. The work was no doubt by Norwegian
artists, for the interlacing foliage is in that
peculiarly graceful and broad style (mentioned by
Mallet and Pontoppidan), which always seems to
have been at home in this country. These beautiful
panels, together with the slender pillars joined
to them, sold at the auction of the old materials
for one dollar!</p>

<p>So little has this valley been modernized, that I
find in almost every house specimens of the Primstav,
or old Runic calendar, handed down from
father to son for centuries. “It is the same with
those tales you have heard,” said the Lehnsman;
“the oldest people in the valley got them from the
oldest people before them, though not in writing,
but by oral tradition.”</p>

<p>“And what is the state of morals up here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Nattefrieri is very much in vogue, but the
evil consequences are not so great as may be
imagined.”</p>

<p>I must own that the revelations of the Lehnsman
stripped those people, in my eyes, of a good
deal of the romance with which their literary tastes
had invested them. Nor was my idea of the artless
and unsophisticated simplicity of these rustic Mirandas
enhanced, when I was told that match-making
was not uncommon among the seniors,
and the juniors consented to be thus bought and
sold. Hear this, ye manœuvring mammas!</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter’s heart.”</p>

</div>

<p>Yes! marriage here, as among the grand folks
elsewhere, turns upon a question of lots of money&mdash;a
handsome establishment. Perhaps, too, the
jilts of refined and polished society will rejoice, to
hear that they are kept in countenance by the
doings in Sætersdal. It sometimes, though rarely,
happens that a girl is engaged to a young fellow,
who means truly by her, the wedding guests are
bidden, and she&mdash;bolts with another man.</p>

<p>Bidding adieu to the kind and hospitable Lehnsman
and his spouse, whose courtesy and hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
made up for the forbidding ways of Madame
Rige, I turned my face up the valley. The carriage-road
having now ceased, my luggage is transposed
to the back of a stout horse, which, like the ancient
Scottish wild cattle, was milk-white, with black
muzzle. The straddle, or wooden saddle, which
crosses his back, is called klöv-sal. Curiously
enough, the Connemara peasants give the name of
“cleve” to the receptacles slung on either side the
ponies for the purpose of carrying peat, and
through which the animal’s back <i>cleaves</i> like a
wedge. A very fat man came puffing and panting
up to my loft to fetch my gear.</p>

<p>“What!” said I, “are <i>you</i> going to march with
me all that distance?” with an audible <i>aside</i> about
his “larding the lean earth as he walks along.”
The allusion to Falstaff he of course did not understand.
His literature is older than Shakspeare;
indeed the bard of Avon often borrowed from it.
Whence comes his “Man in the moon with his
dog and bush,” but from the fiction in the Northern
mythology of Mâni (the moon), and the two
children, Bil and Hiuki, whom she stole from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
earth. Scott’s Wayland Smith, too, he is nothing
but Völund, the son of the Fin-king, who married
a Valkyr by mistake, and used to practise the art
of a goldsmith in Wolf-dale, and was hamstrung
by the avaricious King Nidud, and forced to make
trinkets for him on the desert isle of Saeverstad.
Though it is only fair to say that the legend
belonged also to the Anglo-Saxons, and indeed to
most of the branches of the Gothic race. But we
are forgetting our post-master. He was the first
fat peasant I ever saw in this country.</p>

<p>“Nei, cors” (No, by the Rood). “I’m not
equal to that. It’s nearly four old miles. My
wife, a very snil kone (discreet woman), will schuss
you.”</p>

<p>His better half accordingly appeared, clad in
the dingy white woollen frock already described,
reaching from the knee to the arm-holes, where
is the waist. On this occasion, however, she had,
for the purpose of expedition, put an extra girdle
above her hips, making the brief gown briefer
still, and herself less like a woman about to dance
in a sack. Sending her on before, I sauntered
along, stopping a second or two to examine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
huge unhewn slab before the church door, with a
cross and cypher on it, and the date 1639; to
which stone some curious legend attaches, which I
have forgotten. Passing Solomon’s house, and
finding he had gone to the mountains, I left for
him some flies, and a <i>douceur</i>, to the bewilderment
of his son. At a house further up the valley I
found a primstav two hundred years old, the
owner of which perfectly understood the Runic
symbols.</p>

<p>“That goose,” said he, “refers to Martinsmass,
(Nov. 11). That’s the time when the geese are
ready to kill.”</p>

<p>So that our derivation of Michaelmas goose-eating
from the old story of Queen Elizabeth
happening to have been eating that dish on
the day of the news of the defeat of the Spanish
Armada, is a myth. We got the custom from
Norway, but the bird being fit to eat on the
29th September, Englishmen were too greedy to
wait, and transferred to the feast of the archangel
the dish appertaining to the Bishop of Tours.</p>

<p>That’s a lyster for Saint Lucia (13th Dec.); it
means that they used to catch much fish against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Yule. That knife means that it is time to
slaughter the pigs for Yule. That horn is Yule-horn
[the vehicle for conveying ale to the throats
of the ancient Norskmen]. That’s Saint Knut
(Jan. 7th). That’s his bell, to ring winter out.
The sun comes back then in Thelemarken. Old
folks used to put their hands behind their backs,
take a wooden ale-bowl in their teeth, and throw
it over their back; if it fell bottom upwards, the
person would die in that year. That’s St. Brettiva,
(Jan. 11), when all the leavings of Yule are eat up.
You see the sign is a horse. I’ll tell you how that
is. Once on a time a bonder in Thelemarken was
driving out that day. The neighbour (nabo) asked
him if he knew it was Saint Brettiva’s day. He
answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Brett me here, brett me there,</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll brett (bring) home a load of hay, I swear.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The horse stumbled, and broke its foot; that’s
the reason why the day is marked with a horse in
Thelemarken.</p>

<p>“That’s St. Blasius (Feb. 3), marked with a
ship. If it blows (bläse) on that day, it will blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
all the year through. That’s a very particular
day. We must not use any implement that goes
round on it, such as a mill, or a spindle, else
the cattle would get a swimming in the head
(Sviva).</p>

<p>“That’s St. Peter’s key (Feb. 22). Ship-folks
begin to get their boats ready then. As the
weather is that day it will be forty days after.</p>

<p>“That,” continued this learned decipherer of
Runes, “is St. Matthias (24th Feb.) If it’s cold
that day, it will get milder, and <i>vice versâ</i>; and
therefore the saying is, St. Matthias bursts the
ice; if there is no ice, he makes ice. The fox
darn’t go on the ice that day for fear it should
break.</p>

<p>“That’s a mattock (hakke) for St. Magnus
(16th April). We begin then to turn up the soil.</p>

<p>“That’s St. Marcus (25th April). That’s Stor
Gangdag (great procession-day). The other gang-days
are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before
Ascension.”</p>

<p>“And why are they called Gang-days?”</p>

<p>“Because a procession used to go round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fields, and the priest, at their head, held mass, to
drive away all evil spirits.”</p>

<p>Here, then, we see the origin of our beating the
bounds. Although, perhaps, the custom may be
traced to some ceremonial in honour of Odin akin
to the Ambarvalia at Rome in honour of Ceres.
According to an old tradition, however, it originated
thus. There was, many years ago, a great
drought in Norway about this period of the year.
A general procession-day was ordered in consequence,
together with a fast, which was kept so
strictly, that the cattle were muzzled, and the babe
in the cradle kept from the breast. Just before the
folks went to church it was as dry as ever, but when
they came out, it was raining hard. We Christians
ring the “passing bell” on the death of anybody,
but are perhaps not aware that it began in northern
superstition. Sprites, as we have mentioned elsewhere,
can’t bear bells&mdash;one of them was once
heard lamenting in Denmark that he could stay
no longer in the country on account of the din of
the church bells. So, to scare away the evil spirits,
and let the departing soul have a quiet passage,
the sexton tolls the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s Gowk’s-mass (May 1); you see the
gowk (cuckoo) in the tree. That’s a great bird
that. They used to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">North, corpse-gowk, south, sow-gowk,</div>
<div class="verse">West, will-gowk, east, woogowk.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What’s the meaning of that?”</p>

<p>“Why, if you heard the cuckoo first in the
north, the same year you would be a corpse; if in
the south, you would have luck in sowing; if in the
west, your will would be accomplished; if in the
east, you would have luck in wooing.</p>

<p>“That’s Bjornevaak (bear’s waking day) May 22.

<p>The “Tale of the Calendar”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was, however, now
interrupted by a tap at the window, and a man
screams out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Where is the Fremmad man? where is the
Fremmad man?”</p>

<p>“The stranger is here in the house,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>And in came a man, who had evidently just
dressed in his best, with something very like
death written in his sunken cheeks, starting eyes,
and sharpened features.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what is good for so and so?”
he asked. “Oh! what pain I endure.”</p>

<p>The poor fellow was clearly suffering from the
stone, and there was no doctor within a great many
days’ journey. His doom was evidently sealed.</p>

<p>Further up the valley, a fierce thunder-storm
coming on, I entered one of the smoke-houses
above described, where an old lady, Gunvor Thorsdatter,
bid me welcome. She offered me her mull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of home-dried sneeshing&mdash;it was rather a curious
affair, being shaped like a swan’s-egg pear, and
sprigged all over with silver. A very small aperture,
stopped by a cork, was the only way of
getting at the precious dust. Gunvor was above
eighty, but in full possession of her faculties, and
I judged her therefore not an unlikely person to
have some old stories.</p>

<p>“What do you sing to the babies when you
want to make them sleep?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. All sorts of things.”</p>

<p>“Well, will you repeat me one?”</p>

<p>She looked hard at me for a moment, and suddenly
all the deep furrows across her countenance
puckered up and became contorted, just like a
ploughed field when the harrow has passed over
it. A stifled giggle next escaped her through
her <i>erkos odontôn</i>, which was still white, and
without gaps. A slight suspicion that I was
making fun of her I at once removed from her
mind; then, looking carefully round, and seeing
that there was nobody else by, she croaked out,
in a sort of monotonous melody, the following,
which I give literally in English:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>“Very good,” said I. “Many thanks. Have
you any gaade (riddles)?”</p>

<p>Upon which, the old lady immediately repeated
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Sister sent to sister her’n,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Southwards over the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">With its bottom out, a silver churn,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Before parting with her, I begged the old lady
to accept a small coin in return for her rhymes,
which she said she had heard from her grandmother;
but this she indignantly refused to
accept, begging me at the same time, as she saw
a man approaching, not to say a word about what
she had been telling me. The fact is, as has been
observed by the Norwegians themselves, that the
peasants fancy that nobody would inquire about
these matters unless for the sake of ridiculing them,
of which they have a great horror. Although they
retain these rhymes themselves, they imagine that
other people must look upon them as useless
nonsense.</p>

<p>The man who approached the cottage brought
with him a tiny axe, a couple of inches long,
which he had dug up in the neighbourhood. Its
use I could not conceive, unless, perhaps, it was
the miniature representation of some old warrior’s
axe, which the survivors were too knowing and
parsimonious to bury with the corpse, and so they
put in this sham. That the ancient Scandinavians
were addicted to this thrift is well known. In
Copenhagen, as we have already seen, facsimiles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on a very small scale, of bracelets, &amp;c. which have
been found in barrows, are still preserved. This
peasant had likewise a bear-skin for sale. The
bear he shot last spring, and the meat was bought
by the priest.</p>

<p>The storm being over, I walked on through the
forest alone, my female guide being by this time,
no doubt, many miles in advance. All houses had
ceased, but, fortunately, there was but one path,
so that I could not lose my way. How still the
wood was! There was not a breath of wind after
the rain, so that I could distinctly hear the sullen
booming of the river, now some distance off. As I
stopped to pick some cloud-berries, which grew in
profusion, I heard a distant scream. It was some
falcons at a vast height on the cliff above, which I
at first thought were only motes in my eyes. With
my glass I could detect two or three pairs. They
had young ones in the rock, which they were teaching
to fly, and were alternately chiding them and
coaxing them. No wonder the young ones are
afraid to make a start of it. If I were in their
places I should feel considerable reluctance about
making a first flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>At length I spied a cottage to the right in the
opening of a lateral valley. Hereabout, I had
heard, were some old bauta stones; but an
intelligent girl who came up, told me a peasant
had carried them off to make a wall. This girl,
who wore two silver brooches on her bosom,
besides large globular collar-studs and gilt
studs to her wristbands, asked me if I would
not come and have a mjelk drikke (drink of
milk).</p>

<p>Jorand Tarjeisdatter was all the time busily
engaged in chewing harpix (the resinous exudation
of the fir-tree); presently, on another older
woman coming in, she pulled out the quid,
and gave it to the new-comer, who forthwith
put it into her own mouth. But after all
this is no worse than Dr. Livingstone drinking
water which had been sucked up from
the ground by Bechuana nymphs, and spit
out by them into a vessel for the purpose.</p>

<p>Jorand was nice-looking, and had a sweet voice,
and without the least hesitation she immediately
sang me one or two lullabies, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Full of ale and wine,</div>
<div class="verse">So dance my lady down.</div>

</div>

<p>She then chanted the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Hasten, hasten, then my goats</div>
<div class="verse">Along the northern heights,</div>
<div class="verse">Homewards over rocky fell,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>She then started off with a stave full of satirical
allusions to the swains of the neighbourhood,
showing how Od was braw, and Ola a stour prater
(stor Pratar), Torgrim a fop, and Tarjei a Gasconader&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">But Björn from all he bore the bell,</div>
<div class="verse">So merry he, and could “stave” so well.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole reminded me of the catalogue in
the glee of “Dame Durden.”</p>

<p>“But how long will you stop with us? If you’ll
wait till Sunday, we’ll have a selskab (party). Some
of the men will come home from the mountains,
and then you shall hear us stave properly.”</p>

<p>She seemed much disappointed when I told her
I must be off there and then, my luggage was
already miles ahead.</p>

<p>Leaving her with thanks, I made a detour of
a couple of miles into the side valley, to see a very
ancient gaard, to which a story attaches. Roynestad,
as it was called, was built of immense logs,
some as much as three feet thick;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
which several bullet marks were visible. Here
once dwelt a fellow bearing the same names as the
murderer of the priest at Valle, viz., Wund Osmund.
He had served in the wars, and seen much of
foreign lands. For some reason he incurred the
displeasure of the authorities, and fled for refuge
to his mountain home. A party of officials came
to seize him. When he saw them approaching, he
took aim with his cross-bow at a maalestock (pole
for land-measuring), which he had placed in the
meadow in front of his house, and sent three or
four shafts into it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Cloudesley with a bearing arrow</div>
<div class="verse">Clave the wand in two.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Dogberries were alarmed, and, after discharging
a few bullets, turned tail.</p>

<p>There were in the loft some curious reminiscences
of this daring fellow, <i>e.g.</i>, an ancient sword,
and some old tapestry, or rather canvas painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
over with some historical subject, which I could
not make out. In ancient times the interior of
the houses was often decorated with hangings of
this kind (upstad, aaklæd). But what I chiefly
wanted to see was a genuine old Pagan idol, which
had been preserved on the spot many hundred
years. But “Faxe,” I found, was not long ago
split up for fuel. The real meaning of “faxe” is
horse with uncut mane, so that it was most likely
connected with the worship of Odin.</p>

<p>Regaining my old road, by a short cut, which
fortunately did not turn out a longer way, I plodded
on to Bjaräen, a lonely house in the forest. Here I
found my excellent conductress, who, alarmed at my
non-appearance, had halted, and it being now dusk,
further advance to-night was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Those horrible cupboards, or berths, fixed against
the wall, how I dreaded getting into one of them!
A stout, red-cheeked lass, the daughter of the
house, was fortunately at home, and posted up the
hill for some distance, returning with a regular
hay-cock on her back, which improved matters.
But before I bestowed myself thereon, I took care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to place under the coverlet a branch of Pors, which
I had cut in the bog. It did for me what the
aureus ramus did, if I remember rightly, for
Æneas, gained me access to the realms of sleep.
The fleas, it is true, mustered strong, and moved
vigorously to the attack, but the scent of the shrub
seemed to take away their appetite for blood, and I
remained unmolested.</p>

<p>The stout lass brought me a slop-basin to wash
in next morning, and instead of a towel, an article
apparently not known in these parts, a clean
chemise of her own. The house could not, by-the-bye,
boast of any knives and forks. No sugar
was to be had, and the milk, which was about three
months old, was so sharp that it seemed to get into
my head, certainly into my nose.</p>

<p>Next morning, after some miles walk through
uninterrupted solitudes, I found myself on the
shores of a placid lake, from which the mist was
just lifting up its heavy white wings. As I stood
for a moment to look, a large fly descended on the
smooth water, and was immediately gobbled up by
a trout. Over head, half hidden in the mist, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
perpendicular white precipices, stained with streaks
of black, which returned my halloo with prompt
defiance. Between their base and the lake vast
stone blocks were strewed around, and yet close by
I now discovered a farm-house exposed to a similar
fall.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">On fair Loch Ranza shone the early day,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Soft wreaths of cottage smoke are upward curled</div>
<div class="verse">From the lone hamlet, which her inland bay</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And circling mountains sever from the world.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">That’s a very proper quotation, no doubt, but the
smoke must be left out. The farm was deserted;
not a soul at home, the family having gone up to
the mountain pasture. We must, however, except
a couple of sad and solitary magpies, which, as we
drew near, uttered some violent interjections, and
jumped down from the house-top, where they had
been pruning themselves in the morning sun. They
must be much in want of company, for they followed
our steps for some distance, and then left us
with a peculiar cry. Would that I had been an
ancient augur to have known what that last observation
of theirs was!</p>

<p>The path now wound up the noted Bykle Sti, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ladder of Bykle, which is partly blasted out of the
rocks, and partly laid on galleries of fir logs.
Formerly, this place was very dangerous to the
traveller. Here the river, which has been flowing
at no great distance from us all the way, comes out
of a lake. From a considerable height I gaze down
below, and see it gurgling and then circling with oily
smoothness through a series of black pits scooped
out in the foundation rocks of this fine defile. Opposite
me is a huge precipice, whence the screams
that are borne ever and anon upon my ear, proclaim
the vicinity of an eagle’s eyrie. Below, the river
widens again, and I see a number of logs slumbering
heads and tails on its shores. We are now more
than two thousand feet above the sea, but shall
have to descend again to the lake, and cross it, as
the road soon terminates entirely.</p>

<p>The ferry-boat was large and flat-bottomed, but
all the efforts of my attendant and myself failed to
launch it. At this moment a sort of Meg Merrilies,
clad in grey frieze, with hair to match, streaming
over her shoulders, made her appearance.</p>

<p>“Come and help us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s no use. The boat’s fast; the water has
fallen from the dry weather, and old Erik himself
can’t move it.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us try. You take one oar, and Thora
the other, and I’ll go and haul in front.”</p>

<p>The two women used their oars like levers, when
suddenly, Oh, horror!&mdash;snap went one of them.
Tearing up a plank, which was nailed over the gunwale
as a seat, I placed it as a launching way for
the leviathan. This helped us wonderfully, and at
last the unwieldly machine floated. The Danish
Count would have flung “Trahuntque siccas machinæ
carinas” in our faces, but he would have
had to alter the epithet, as the boat was thoroughly
water-logged. So much so, that when the horse
and effects and we three were on board, it leaked
very fast. The women took the oars, the broken
one being mended by the garters of Meg Merrilies.
The water rose in the boat much quicker than I
liked, and I could not help envying a couple of
great Northern divers, which my glass showed me
floating corkily on the smooth water&mdash;fortunately
it was so&mdash;if the truth were known they doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
looked upon us with a mixture of commiseration
and contempt.</p>

<p>When we arrived safely on the other side, which
was distant about half-a-mile, I gave our help-in-need
sixpence. She was perfectly amazed at my
liberality.</p>

<p>“Du er a snil karro du.” (You’re a good fellow,
you are.)</p>

<p>She was, she told me, the mother of fourteen
children. Her pluck and sagacity were considerable.
Now, will it be believed, that this awkward passage
might altogether be avoided if the precipice were
blasted for two or three score yards, so as to allow
of the path winding round it. As it is, a traveller
might arrive here, and if the boat were on the
other side, might wait for a whole day or more, as
nobody could hear or see him, and no human habitation
is near.</p>

<p>As we rose the hill to Bykle, I saw two or three
species of mushrooms, one of which, of a bright
Seville-orange colour, with white imposthumes, I
found to be edible. Visions of a comfortable place
to put my head into smiled upon me, as I saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
church-spire rising up the mountain, and a gaard,
the station-house, not far from it. But alas! I
was doomed to be disappointed&mdash;all the family were
at the Stöl, and the doors and windows fastened.
A man fortunately appeared presently, whom I
persuaded for a consideration to go and fetch
the landlord. My guide meantime departed, as
she was anxious to get half home before night.
Meantime I lay on some timbers, and went to sleep.
Out of this I was awakened by a sharp sort of
chuckle close to my ear, and on raising myself I
found that two magpies had bitten a hole into the
sack, and were getting at my biscuits and cheese.
It was with some difficulty that I drove off these
impudent Gazza-ladras: and as soon as I went
to sleep again, they recommenced operations.
In three hours the messenger returned with the
intelligence that the station-master would not
come; the road stopped here, and he was not
bound to schuss people Nordover (to the North).</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go up the mountain,
and wade through the morasses to see the
fellow. Fortunately I found an adjoining stöl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
where dwelt another peasant, Tarald (Anglicè
Thorold) Mostue, whom I persuaded to come down
and open his house for the shelter of myself and
luggage. He brought down with him some fresh
milk, the first I had tasted since leaving Christiansand.
After lighting for me a fire, and making up
a bed, he returned to his châlet, promising to return
by six <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> with a horse, and schuss me to
Vatnedal. Here, then, I was all alone, but I
managed to make myself comfortable, and slept well
under the shadow of my own fig-tree&mdash;I mean the
branch of Pors&mdash;secure from the fleas and bugs!
Tarald appeared in the morning, and off we
started. He was, I found, one of the Lesere or
Norwegian methodists.</p>

<p>“Do they bann (banne = the Scotch ‘ban’)
much in the country you come from?” inquired
he, as we jumped over the dark peat-hags, planting
our feet on the white stones, which afforded a
precarious help through them.</p>

<p>“I fear some of them do.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve not heard you curse.”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t think it right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where does the Pope (Pave) live?”</p>

<p>“At Rome.”</p>

<p>“They call it the great &mdash;&mdash; of Babylon, don’t
they? Is Babylon far from Rome?”</p>

<p>“It does not exist now. It was destroyed for
the wickedness of its inhabitants, and according to
the prophecy it has become something like this
spot here, a possession for the cormorant and the
bittern, and pools of water.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I had forgotten about that; I know the
New Testament very well, but not the Old.”</p>

<p>Tarald had also something to say about Luther’s
Postils; but like most of these Lesere, he had no
relish for a good story or legend. He had a cock-and-a-bull
story&mdash;excuse the confusion of ideas&mdash;of
a bear and a fox, but it was so rigmarole and
pointless, that it reminded me of Albert Smith’s
engineer’s story. The real tale is as follows. I
picked it up elsewhere:&mdash;Once on a time, when the
beasts could talk, a fox and a bear agreed to live
together and have all things in common. So they
got a bit of ground, and arranged, so that one year
the bear should get the tops and the fox the bottoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the crop, and another year the bear the bottoms
and the fox the tops. The first year they sowed
turnips, and, according to agreement, the bear got
the tops and the fox the bottoms. The bear did not
much like this, but the fox showed him clearly
that there was no injustice done, as it was just as
they had agreed. Next year, too, said he, the
bear would have the advantage, for he would get
the bottoms and the fox the tops. In the spring
the fox said he was tired of turnips. “What said
the bear to some other crop?” “Well and good,”
answered the bear. So they planted rye. At
harvest the fox got all the grain, and the bear the
roots, which put him in a dreadful rage, for, being
thick-witted, he had not foreseen the hoax. At
last he was pacified, and they now agreed to buy a
keg of butter for the winter. The fox, as usual,
was up to his tricks, and used to steal the butter at
night, while Bruin slept. The bear observed that
the butter was diminishing daily, and taxed the
fox. The fox replied boldly&mdash;“We can easily find
out the thief; for directly we wake in the morning
we’ll examine each other, and see whether either of
us has any butter smeared about him.” In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
morning the bear was all over butter; it regularly
dropped off him. How fierce he got! the fox was
so afraid, that he ran off into the wood, the bear
after him. The fox hid under a birch-tree root, but
bruin was not to be done, and scratched and
scratched till he got hold of the fox’s foot. “Don’t
take hold of the birch-root, take hold of the fox’s
foot,” said Reynard, tauntingly. So the bear
thought it was only a root he had hold of, and let
the foot go, and began scratching again. “Oh!
now do spare me,” whispered the fox; “I’ll show
you a bees’-nest, which I saw in an old birch. I
know you like honey.” This softened the bear,
for he was desperately fond of honey. So they
went both of them together into the wood, and
the fox showed the bear a great tree-bole, split
down the middle, with the wedge still sticking
in it. “It’s in there,” said the fox. “Just you
squeeze into the crack, and press as hard as you
can, and I’ll strike the wedge, and then the log
will split.” The trustful bear squeezed himself in
accordingly, and pushed as hard as ever he could.
Reynard knocked out the block, the tree closed,
and poor Bruin was fast. Presently the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
came back who had been hewing the tree, and
directly he spied the bear, he took his axe and
split open his skull; and&mdash;so there is no more
to tell.</p>

<p>On the bare, rocky pass which separates Sætersdal
from Vatnedal were several stones, placed in
a line, a yard or two apart from each other.</p>

<p>“Those are the Bridal Stones,” observed Tarald.
“A great many years ago there was no priest on
the Bykle side (I suppose this was after the murder
by Wund Osmond, the Lehnsman), and a couple
that wanted to wed came all the way over here to
be married. Those stones they set up in memory
of the event. On this stone sat the bridegroom,
and on that the bride.”</p>

<p>The mountain pink (Lycnis viscaria) occurs on
most of these stony plateaus. I also met with
a mighty gentian, with purplish brown flower,
emitting a rich aromatic odour, the root of which
is of an excessively bitter taste, and is gathered
for medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>A mile or two beyond this we stood in a rocky
gorge, from which we had a glorious view of the
Vatnedal lake, and another beyond it several hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
feet below us. After a very precipitous descent,
on the edge of which stood several blocks,
placed as near as they could be without rolling
over, we skirted the lake through birch-grove and
bog till we got opposite a house visible on the further
shore. At this a boat was kept, but it was
very uncertain whether anybody was at home.
Leaving Tarald to make signals, I was speedily
enticing some trout at a spot where a snow-stream
rushed into the lake. At last Tarald cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>“All right, there are folk; I see a woman.”
And sure enough, after a space, I could discern a
boat approaching. A brisk and lively woman was
the propelling power. We were soon on the bosom
of the deep&mdash;the two men, the woman, and the
horse, all, in spite of my protestations, consigned
to a flat-bottomed leaky punt, though the wind was
blowing high. The horse became uneasy, and
swayed about, and, being larger than usual, he gave
promise of turning the boat upside-down before
very long. I immediately unlaced my boots, and
pulled off my coat. The Norwegians seemed at
this to awake to a sense of danger, and rowed back
to the shore; the horse was landed and hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
when he forthwith began cropping the herbage.
We then made a safe passage. Unfortunately,
Helge’s husband, whom I had counted on to help
me on my journey, had started with his horse
the day before to buy corn at Suledal, thirty-five
miles off.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, I begged Tarald to take pity on
me, or I might be hopelessly stopped for some
days. The “Leser” was like “a certain Levite.”
He had been complaining all day of fatigue. He
felt so ill, he said, he could hardly get along. I had
even given him some medicine. In spite, however,
of his praiseworthy antipathy to swearing, and the
nasal twang with which he poured out some of his
moral reflections, I had felt some misgivings about
the sincerity of his professions; for he had begged
me to write to the Foged, and complain of the
absence of the station-master at Bykle, that he
might be turned out, and he get his place. And,
sure enough, I found him to be a wooden nutmeg
with none of the real spice of what he professed to
be about him. No sooner did he finger the dollars,
than his fatigue and indisposition suddenly left
him, and he started off home with great alacrity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
reminding me of those cripples in Victor Hugo’s
<i>Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>, who, from being hardly
able to crawl, suddenly became all life and motion.</p>

<p>“Truly,” mused I, “these Lesere are all moonshine.
They profess to be a peculiar people, but
are by no means zealous of good works. But this
lies in the nature of things. Which is the best
article, the cloth stiffened and puffed up with starch
and ‘Devil’s dust,’ or the rough Tweed, which
makes no pretence to show whatever, but, nevertheless,
does duty admirably well against wind and
weather?” But enough of the thin-lipped, Pharisaical
Tarald.</p>

<p>There was a beaminess about the hard-favoured
countenance of Helge Tarjeisdatter Vatnedal, together
with a <i>brusque</i> out-and-out readiness of
word and deed, that jumped with my humour. The
fair Tori too, her daughter, with her good-tempered
blue eyes and mouth, and comfortable-looking
figure, swept up the floor, and split some pine
stumps with an axe, and lit the fire, and acted
“Polly put the kettle on” with such an evident resolve
to make me at home, that the prospect of
being delayed in such quarters looked much less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
formidable. The two women had netted some
gorgeous trout that afternoon, and I was soon
discussing them.</p>

<p>“We must go now,” said Helge.</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“To the stöl. We are all up there now. It was
only by chance we came down here to-day. Will
you go with us, or will you stop here? You will
be all alone.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; I’ll stop here.”</p>

<p>“Very good. We know of a man living a long
way off on the other lake. We’ll send a messenger
to him by sunrise, and see if he can schuss you.
In the morning we’ll come back and let you
know.”</p>

<p>My supper finished, by the fast waning light
I began reading a bit of Bulwer’s <i>Caxtons</i>. The
passage I came upon was Augustine’s recipe for
satiety or <i>ennui</i>&mdash;viz., a course of reading of
legendary out-of-the-way travel. But I can give
Mr. Caxton a better nostrum still&mdash;To do the
thing yourself instead of reading of it being
done. In the Museum at Berlin there is a picture
called the Fountain of Youth. On the left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
side you see old and infirm people approaching, or
being brought to the water. Before they have got
well through the stream, their aspect changes; and
arrived on the other bank, they are all rejuvenescence
and frolic. To my mind this is not a bad
emblem of the change that comes over the traveller
who passes out of a world of intense over-civilization
into a country like this. How delightful to
be able to dress, and eat, and do as one likes, to
have escaped for a season, at least, from the tittle-tattle,
the uneasy study of appearances, the “what
will Mr. So-and-so think?” the fuss and botheration
of crowded cities, with I don’t know how
many of the population thinking of nothing
but getting 10 per cent. for their money. Sitting
alone in the gloaming, under the shadow of the
great mountains, with the darkling lake in front,
now once more tranquil, and lulled again like a babe
that has cried itself to sleep&mdash;the sound of the distant
waterfalls booming on the ear&mdash;a star or two
twinkling faintly in the sky&mdash;I might have set my
fancy going to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>But bed, with its realities, recalled my wandering
thoughts. That was the hour of trial! A person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
who ought to know something about these matters,
apostrophized sleep as being fond of smoky cribs,
and uneasy pallets, and delighting in the hushing
buzz of night flies. I had all these to perfection,
the flies especially, quite a plague of them. But
nature’s soft nurse would not visit me. The fact
was, I had lost my branch, and the “insectivora” of
all descriptions, as a learned farmer of my acquaintance
phrased it, roved about like free companions,
ravaging at will. Knocked up was I completely
the next morning, when at six o’clock the women
returned with the welcome intelligence that one
Ketil of the Bog was bound for that Goshen, Suledal,
to buy corn, and would be my guide.</p>

<p>“I am so weary,” said I; “I have not slept a
wink.”</p>

<p>With looks full of compassion, the women observed&mdash;“We
thought you wouldn’t. We knew
you would be afraid. That kept you awake, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>Whether they meant fear of the fairies or of
freebooters, they did not say. My assurance to
the contrary availed but little to convince them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
No solitary traveller in Norway at the present day
need fear robbery or violence. The women soon
shouldered my effects, not permitting me to carry
anything, and we started through morass, and
brake, and rocks, for the shieling of Ketil of the
Bog.</p>

<p>At one spot where we rested, the fair Tori chanted
me the following strain, which is based on a national
legend, the great antiquity of which is testified by
the alliterative metre of the original. It refers to
a girl who had been carried off by robbers.</p>

<p>I was quite at Ketil’s mercy in a pecuniary point
of view. But he was not one of the Lesere, and
was moderate in his demands. After a scramble
through his native bog, which would, I think, have
put a very moss-trooper on his mettle, we debouched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
on the end of a lake. Here we took boat, and
there being a spanking breeze, we soon shot over
the six miles of water. With a stern-wind, fishing
was not to be thought of; I never found it answer.
At the other end of the lake was a stone cabin,
where I took shelter from the blast, while Ketil
went in search of his horse.</p>

<p>While I was engaged caulking the seams in my
appetite, a fine young fellow in sailor’s costume,
who had rowed from the opposite shore, looked in.
Talleif, as he was yclept, was from Tjelmodal,
with a flock of fourteen thousand sheep and twenty
milking goats. He and his comrade, Lars, sleep
in an old bear-hole in the Urden (loose rocks).
They get nine skillings (threepence) a-head for
tending the sheep for ten weeks. Besides this,
they pay twelve dollars to Ketil and two other
peasants, who are the possessors of these wilds.
Their chief food is the milk of the goats. In
winter they get their living by fishing.</p>

<p>“Have you any ryper here,” said I to Ketil, as
we passed through some very likely-looking birch
thickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What colour?”</p>

<p>“Grey.”</p>

<p>“Are there no brown ones?”</p>

<p>“No; they are grey, and in winter snow-white.”</p>

<p>At this instant I heard the well-known cackle of
the cock of the brown species, and a large covey of
these birds rose out of the covert.</p>

<p>“Well, they are brown,” said he; “now, I never
laid mark to (remarked) that before.”</p>

<p>So much for the observation of these people.
Never rely upon them for any information respecting
birds, beasts, fishes, or plants. All colours
are the same to a blind man, and they are such. I
take the man’s word, however, for the fact of
there being abundance of otters about and reindeer
higher up.</p>

<p>Terribly desolate was that Norwegian Fjeld that
now lay before us. But setting our faces resolutely
to the ascent, we topped it in two and a
half hours, the way now and then threading mossy
lanes, so to say, sunk between sloping planes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
rock. Screeching out in the unharmonious jargon
of Vatnedal, which the Sætersdal people, proud of
their own musical lungs, call “an alarm,” Ketil
pointed to a row of stones upon the ridge similar
to those I had seen the day before, also called the
Bridal stones, and with a similar legend attached
to them. What poverty of invention. Why not
call them Funeral stones by way of ringing the
changes? But no; the people of this country
will escort a bride much further than a bier.
The honours of sepulture are done with a niggard
grace.</p>

<p>As we now began to descend past beds of
unmelted snow, I had a good opportunity of seeing
the manifest effect of glacial action upon the rocks,
the strata of which had been heaved up perpendicularly.
Rounded by the ice in one direction,
and quartered by their own cleavage in another,
the rocks looked for all the world like a vast dish
of sweetbreads; just the sort of tid-bit for that
colossal Jotul yonder behind us, with the portentously
groggy nose, who stands out in sharp
relief against the sky. What Gorgon’s head did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
that? thought I; as the picture in the National
Gallery of Phineus and Co. turned to stone at the
banquet occurred to my mind. But my reverie
was disturbed by a cry from Ketil of the Bog.</p>

<p>“Catch hold of her tail!”</p>

<p>Which exclamation I not apprehending at the
moment, the mare slipped down a smooth sweetbread,
and nearly came to grief.</p>

<p>Lower down we passed some ice-cold tarns,
where I longed to bathe and take some of the
limpid element into my thirsting pores, but prudently
abstained. After a long descent we came upon
a deserted châlet, the door of which we unfastened,
and plundered it of some sour milk. We shall
pay the owner down below. After this refreshment
we plunged into a deep gorge, skirting an elv just
fresh from its cradle, and which was struggling to
get away most lustily for so young an infant.</p>

<p>“Ah! it’s only small now,” said Ketil; “but
you should see it in a flom (flood). It’s up in a
moment. Two years ago a young fellow crossed
there with a horse, and spent the day in cutting
grass on the heights. It rained a good deal. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
waited too long, and when he tried to get over,
horse and man were drowned. They were found
below cut to pieces.”</p>

<p>I must take care what I’m about, thought I, as I
nearly slipped down the precipice, which was
become slippery from a storm of rain which now
overtook us.</p>

<p>Below this the scenery becomes more varied, in
one place a smiling little amphitheatre of verdure
contrasting with the bold mountains which towered
to an immense height above.</p>

<p>At length we descend to Suledal lake drenched
to the skin. A ready, off-hand sort of fellow,
Thorsten Brathweit, at once answers my challenge
to row me over the water to Naes. The scenery
of the lake is truly superb. The elv, which we had
been following, here finds its way to the lake by a
mere crack through the rocks of great depth.
In one place a big stone that had been hurled
from above had become tightly fixed in the cleft,
and formed a bridge. Thorsten had plenty to
say.</p>

<p>Two reindeer, he told me, were shot last week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
on the Fjeld I had just crossed. Large salmon
get up into the lake. The trout in it run to ten
pounds in weight; what I took were only small.</p>

<p>The landlord at Naes, where I spent the night,
was astonished that I should have ventured
through Sætersdal.</p>

<p>“They are such a Ro-bygd folk there,” observed
he, punningly, <i>i.e.</i>, barbarous sort of people.</p>

<p>The race I now encounter are, in fact, of quite a
different costume and appearance. The married
daughter of the house possessed a good complexioned
oval face, with a close-fitting black cloth
cap, edged with green, in shape just like those
worn by the Dutch vrows, in Netscher’s and
Mieris’ pictures. Her light brown hair was cut
short behind like a boy’s; such is the fashion
among the married women hereabouts.</p>

<p>“Long hair is an ornament to the woman,” observed
I to her.</p>

<p>“She didn’t know; that was the custom there.”</p>

<p>The only spoon in the house was a large wooden
one, but as by long practice I have arrived at
such a pitch of dexterity that I might almost venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
on teaching my grandmother to suck eggs,
this occasioned me little inconvenience in transferring
to my mouth the parboiled mementoes left
by a hen now, alas! no more.</p>

<p>There is a mountain-pass across the Fjeld from
hence to Roldal, and, as I mounted it next morning
by the side of one of the feeders of the lake
cascading grandly down, I had a fine view of this
noble piece of water. After a stiff walk of three
hours and a half we arrive at the summit of the
<i>col</i>, and passing the rnan, or cairn, which marks
the highest point, looked down upon the pretty
Roldal water sunk deep among the mountains, with
the snowfields of the Storfond gleaming in the distance.</p>

<p>Here we met a mournful cavalcade. First came
a sickly-looking man riding, and another horse
following loaded with luggage, while a spruce old
dame and a handsome lad walked in the rear.
This is a rich bonder from Botne below, who is
troubled with a spinal complaint, and after enduring
frightful tortures, is on his travels in search of
a doctor. Horror of horrors! I felt it running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
cold down my back as I heard of it. Imagine a
man with a diseased spine riding down a Norwegian
mountain. Heaven help him! The lad hails me,
and asks if I know where a doctor is to be found.
I recommend Stavanger, sixty miles off&mdash;much of
which distance, however, may be travelled by water&mdash;in
preference to Lillesand, a small place nearer.</p>

<p>It was a great relief, after walking in the intense
heat, to boat across Roldal lake, under the shade
of the mountains, the air deliciously cooled by the
glacier water, which, though milky in colour,
did not prevent me catching some trout. The
poor fellow, my boatman, has a swollen hand and
wrist of some weeks’ standing; I recommend porridge
poultice as hot as possible, and a douche of
icy water afterwards. Formerly, instead of this
simple remedy, it would have been necessary to do
“some great thing.” Abana and Pharpar alone
would have sufficed. I allude to the miraculous
image which used to be kept in the old church at
Roldal, now pulled down. On the Eve of St. John
it used to sweat, and people came from far and near
to apply the exudation to their bodily ailments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Like Dr. Steer’s opodeldoc, it never failed to effect
a cure.</p>

<p>As we approach the other end of the lake, a little
modern church rises on the shore, while an amphitheatre
of cultivated ground, dotted here and there by
log-houses, slopes gently upwards towards the grey
rocky mountains behind, which afford pasturage for
herds of tame reindeer. In the distance may be
discerned at intervals a winding path. This path,
which at present is only practicable for horses,
crosses the summit level of the Hardanger mountains.
At Gugaard it becomes a carriage-road, and
thence passes on through Vinje to the part of Thelemarken
visited by me last year. The Storthing
have long been talking of completing the post-road
from Gugaard to Busteten, on the Sör Fjord, a
branch of the Hardanger; but hitherto it is confined
to talk, although, at present, the only way of
getting from the Hardanger district to Kongsberg
and the capital, is either to go the long route by the
sea round the Naze, or up to Leirdalsören, where
the high road commences. Formerly Roldal parish
was annexed to Suledal, thirty miles off, but it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lately been separated, and has the advantage of a
resident clergyman, and service every Sunday.</p>

<p>Sending my effects to the Lehnsman’s, where I
purposed stopping the night, I went up the hill to
call upon his reverence. He was out, so the girl
went to fetch him, taking care to lock the house-door
and put the key in her pocket. Presently a
vinegar-faced, Yankee-looking young man, with
white neckcloth, light coat, and pea-green waistcoat,
with enormous flowers embroidered on it, and
sucking a cigar the colour of pig-tail, approached.
There was a Barmecide look about him, which was
not promising, and his line of action tallied exactly
with his physiognomy. He stood before the
house-door, but made no effort to open it, and
there was a repelling uncommunicative way about
him, which determined me to retire the moment I
had obtained the information I stood in need of.</p>

<p>As I had landed from the boat, a ragged square-built
little fellow, with gipsy countenance, had
offered to carry my luggage, seventy pounds in
weight, over the mountain to Odde, thirty miles
distance. Showing me a miserable little hut, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
told me he was very poor, and had five children
with no bread to eat, while his wife, a tidy-looking
woman carrying a bundle of sticks, chimed in with
his entreaties, and thanked me warmly for the gift
of the few fish I had caught. I was quite willing
to hire him, and had come to the priest, to whom
he referred me, for some account of his trustworthiness
and capabilities.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his reverence, “he is able to carry
that weight; he carried for me more than double
as much when I came hither from Odde, and that’s
much more uphill (imod).”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “but I travel quick, and I don’t
wish to use a man as a beast of burden.”</p>

<p>“He lives by carrying burdens. And what do
you want, Knut, for the job?”</p>

<p>“A dollar.”</p>

<p>“That’s too much.”</p>

<p>I did not think so, and the bargain was struck,
and I took leave of the vinegar-cruet, who was said
to be a chosen vial of pulpit declamation.</p>

<p>What a set of bores or burrs my host the Lehnsman
and his family were. They would not let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
alone in the loft, which was frightfully hot, and
with no openable window. Up tramped first the
old man, with half-a-dozen loutish sons, then followed
a hobbling old beldam, leaning on a stick,
and attended by Brida, a young peasant lass, the
only redeeming feature in the group. Fancy
arriving at a place dog-tired, and a dozen people
surrounding you in the foreground, and asking a
hundred questions, with a perspective of white
heads bobbing about, and appearing and disappearing
through the doorway in the middle distance.</p>

<p>My only chance was my pencil; that is the
weapon to repel such intruders. Not that I used
it aggressively, as those hopeful students did
their styles (see Fox’s <i>Martyrs</i>), digging the sharp
points into their Dominie’s body. Taking out my
sketch-book, I deliberately singled out one of the
phalanx, and commenced transferring his proportions
to the paper. This manœuvre at once
routed the assailants, and they retired. Before
long, however, the old gent stole in, and prowled
stealthily around the fortress before he summoned
it to surrender. I parried all his questions, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
departed. His place was then supplied by his
eldest son, who was equally unsuccessful, but
whom I made useful in boiling some water for tea.
The only thing approaching to a tea-pot was a
shallow kettle, a foot in diameter. The butter of
Roldal is celebrated, and compared to the Herregaard
butter of Denmark, but the pile of it brought
in by the landlord’s son, on a lordly dish, was stale
and nauseous. As nothing was to be got out of
me, he, too, disappeared, and I was left in peace
and quietness. Another yet! Horrible sight! the
old Hecate herself again rises into the loft&mdash;not
one of “the soft and milky rabble” of womankind,
spoken of by the poet, but a charred and wrinkled
piece of humanity&mdash;all shrivelled and toothless,
came and stood over me as I sat at meat.</p>

<p>“Who are you? You <i>shall</i> tell me. Whence
do you come from?”</p>

<p>“Christiansand.”</p>

<p>“But are you Baarneföd (born) there?”</p>

<p>At the same time she hobbled to a great red
box, with various names painted on it, and as a
kind of bait, I suppose, produced a quaint silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
spoon for my use, which she poised suspiciously
in her hand like a female Euclio, as if she was
fearful I should swallow it.</p>

<p>But I was much too tired to respond; and at
last, seeing nothing was to be got out of me, she
crawled away, and I was speedily between the
woollen coverlets&mdash;sheets there were none. By
five <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> the gipsy Knut was in attendance, with
a small son to help him; and on a most inspiriting
morning we skirted along the lake, and began to
mount the heights. The haze that still hung
about the water, and filled the shadowy nooks
between the mountains, lent an ineffable grandeur
to them, which the mid-day atmosphere, when
the sun is high in heaven, fails to communicate.</p>

<p>Leaving my coolies to advance up the track, I
thought I would take a short cut to the summit of
the pass, when I came unexpectedly upon a lake,
which stretched right and left, and compelled me
to retrace my steps for some distance. As I
scrambled along fallen rocks, my leg slipped
through a small opening into a perfect cavern.
Thank God, the limb was not broken, as the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
could not have heard my cries, and I might have
ceased to be, and become a tissue of dry bones
(<i>de mortuo nil nisi bonum</i>), long before I could
have been discovered. That old raven overhead
there, who gave that exulting croak as I fell,
you’re reckoning this time without your host. See,
I have got my leg out of the trap; and off we
hurry from the ill-omened spot. Those ravens are
said to be the ghosts of murdered persons who have
been hidden away on the moors by their murderers,
and have not received Christian burial.</p>

<p>What a delicious breeze refreshed me as I stood,
piping hot, on the top of the pass. Half-an-hour
of this let loose upon London would be better than
flushing the sewers. It was genuine North Sea,
iced with passing over the vast white Folgefond.
There it lies full in front of us, like a huge
winding-sheet, enwrapping the slumbering Jotuns,
those Titanic embodiments of nature in her sternest
and most rugged mood, with which the imagination
of the sons of Odin delighted to people the
fastnesses of their adopted home.</p>

<p>As we had ascended, the trees had become,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
both in number and size, small by degrees and
beautifully less, until they ceased altogether, and
the landscape turned into nothing but craggy,
sterile rockscape. This order of things as we
now descended was inverted, and I was not sorry
to get once more into the region of verdure.</p>

<p>At length we arrive at Seligenstad, where, to
avoid the crowd of questioners, I sit down on a
box, in the passage, to the great astonishment of
the good folks. The German who has preceded
me has been more communicative: “He is from
Hanover; is second master in a Gymnasium; is
thirty years old; has so many dollars a year; is
married; and expects a letter from his wife at
Bergen.”</p>

<p>When the buzz had subsided, and nobody is
looking, one girl, dressed in the Hardanger costume,
viz., a red bodice and dark petticoat, with masculine
chemise, but with the addition of a white
linen cap, shaped like a nimbus by means of a
concealed wooden-frame, comes and sits on a milk-pail
beside me. At my request she sings a lullaby
or two. One of them ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>I vow that the touching address of the daughter

never sounded so sweetly to me in my school-boy
days, as did the lullaby I had just heard. I’m

<p>A strapping peasant lad, joining our <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
I bantered him on the subject of sweethearts.</p>

<p>“You’ve got one. Now, tell me what you sing

<p>With a look of <i>nonchalance</i>, which thinly
covered over an abundance of sheepishness, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
rustic swain pooh-poohed the idea, and, in defiance,
sang the following&mdash;</p>

<p>The girl had completely turned the tables on
the said flippant young fellow, who, by his looks,
abundantly owned the soft impeachment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking leave of these good folks, I pursued my
downward course along the river, which was, however,
hidden by trees and rocks. Suddenly, however,
we got a sight of the torrent in an unexpected
manner. The earth at our feet had sunk into a
deep, well-like hole, leaving, however, between
it and the stream, a great arch of living rock,
crowned with trees like the Prebischthor in the
Saxon Switzerland, only smaller. Soon after this,
we pass a picturesque bridge (Horbro), where the
river roars through a deep and very narrow chasm,
terrible to look down into; and, after some hours’
walking, get the first peep into the placid lake of
Hildal, with two great waterfalls descending the
opposite mountain, as if determined to give <i>éclat</i>
to the river’s entrance therein. Visions of Bavarian
beer, fresh meat, clean sheets, &amp;c., crowd upon my
imagination, as, after catching some trout in crossing
the lake, we land on the little isthmus which
separates the sheet of fresh water from the beautiful
salt-water Sörfjord; and with light foot I
hasten down to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;’s, the merchant of
Odde. The situation is one of the grandest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Norway. The mighty Hardanger Fjord, after running
westward out of the Northern Ocean for
about eighty miles, suddenly takes a bend south,
and forms the Sör (South) Fjord, which is nearly
thirty miles long. At the very extreme end of this
glorious water defile I now stood. To my left shoot
down the sloping abutments of the mountain plateau,
on which lies the vast snow-field called the
Folgefond; they, with their flounce-like bands
of trees, first fir, then birch, and above this
mere scrub, are now immersed in shadow, blending
in the distance with the indigo waters of
the Fjord. But further out to seaward, as we
glance over the dark shoulder of one of these
natural buttresses, rises a swelling mound of white,
like the heaving bosom of some queenly beauty
robed in black velvet. That is a bit of “Folgo”
yet glowing with the radiance of the setting sun.
As I stood gazing at this wonderful scene&mdash;the
snow part of it reminding me of the unsullied
Jungfrau, as seen from Interlacken, only that
there the water, which gives such effect to this
scene, is absent&mdash;I saw a man rise from behind a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
stranded boat in front of me. He was a German
painter, and had been transferring to his canvas
the very sight I had been looking on.</p>

<p>“Eine wunderschöne Aussicht, Mein Herr,”
remarked I.</p>

<p>“Unvergleichbar! We’ve nothing like it even
in Switzerland,” said he.</p>

<p>With this observation I think I can safely leave
the scenery in the reader’s hands.</p>

<p>“That church, there,” said the German, pointing
to a little ancient edifice of stone, with mere
slits of windows, “is said to have been built by
your countrymen, as well as those of Kinservik
and Ullensvang, further down the fjord. They had
a great timber trade, according to tradition, with
this part of the country. But, to judge from that
breastwork and foss yonder, the good people of
the valley were favoured at times with other visits
besides those of timber merchants.”</p>

<p>Next day I went across the Hildal Lake to visit
a glacier of which I had got a glimpse the evening
before. It then seemed a couple of miles
off; but I never was more taken in in judging of
distance before&mdash;such is the uncommon clearness
of the atmosphere and the gigantic scale of objects
in this country. After a sweltering walk,
however, of nearly three hours, I at last stood
at the spot, where a torrent of water, the exact
colour of that perennial sewer that comes to the
light of day, and diffuses its fragrance just below
London Bridge, rushed out of an archway of the
purest azure, setting me a moralizing about deceitful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
appearances, and so forth. My boy-guide
halted the while at a respectful distance from the
convulsed mass of ice.</p>

<p>“Do let me go back,” he had apostrophized me;
“I am so frightened, I am. It is sure to fall on us.”</p>

<p>And it was only by yielding to his cowardly
entreaties that I prevented him from imitating the
trickling ice, and being dissolved in tears.</p>

<p>Close to the ice grew white and red clover,
yellow trefoil, two kinds of sorrel, and buttercups.
This fertility on the edge of a howling
desert had been taken advantage of, for, as I
moved my eye to the opposite cliff from taking
a look at the sun, who had just hidden his scorching
glare behind the tips of the glacier, I descried
several men and women busily engaged, at an
enormous height, making hay on a slope of great
steepness. As we descended, a noise, as of a
salute of cannon, greeted my ears. The above
sewer, which descends with most prodigious
force, had set agoing some stones apparently of
great size, which thundered high even above the
roar of the waters, making the rocks and nodding
groves rebellow again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day I had determined to cross “Folgo” to
the Mauranger Fjord, but the clouds hanging over
him forbid the attempt.</p>

<p>That evening it cleared up, and two compatriots
from the Emerald Isle arriving by water, we agreed
to join forces the next day.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August, at an early hour, we
started with two guides, one Ole Olsen Bustetun,
and Jörgen Olsen Præstergaard. The latter was a
very grave-looking personage, with a blue face and
red-tipped nose, which, however, told untrue tales.</p>

<p>“Well, Jörgen,” said I, “how are you off for
bears this year?”</p>

<p>“Hereabouts, not so bad; but yonder at Ulsvig
they are very troublesome. It was only the
other day that Ulsvig’s priest was going to one of
his churches, when a bear attacked him. By good
luck he had his hound with him&mdash;a very big one
it is&mdash;and it attacked the bear behind, and bothered
him, and so the priest managed to escape.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t there some old sagas about the Folgefond?”
asked I.</p>

<p>“To be sure. I know one, but it is not true.”</p>

<p>“True or not true, let me hear it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then, it is said among the bonders that
once on a time under all this mountain of ice and
snow there was a valley, called Folgedal, with no
less than seven parishes in it. But the dalesmen
were a proud and ungodly crew, and God determined
to destroy them as He did Sodom and
Gomorrah&mdash;not by fire, however, but by snow. So
He caused it to snow in the valley for ten weeks
running. As you may suppose, the valley got
filled up. The church spires were covered, and
not a living soul survived. And from that day to
this the ice and snow has gone on increasing.
They also say that in olden days there used to be
a strange sight of birds of all colours, white, and
black, and green, and red, and yellow, fluskering
about over the snow, and people would have it
that these were nothing but the spirits of the inhabitants
lingering about the place of their former
abodes.”</p>

<p>“That’s a strange story, no doubt,” said I.</p>

<p>“And, now I think of it,” continued Jörgen,
“I’ve heard old men say that this tale of the
snowing-up must be true, for, now and then, when
there has been a flom (flood), pieces of hewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
timber, as if they had belonged to a house, and
household implements, such as copper kettles,
have been brought down by the stream that comes
out of Overhus Glacier.</p>

<p>“Now and then, too, the traveller over Folgo is
said to hear strange noises, as of church bells
ringing and dogs barking. But the fact is, there’s
something so lonely and grewsome about the Fond,
and the ice is so apt to split and the snow to fall,
that no wonder people get such-like fancies into
their heads.”</p>

<p>As we ascend I see tufts of a dark green herb
growing in the crevices of the grey rocks.</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s spraengehesten (horse burster),”
said Jörgen. “If a horse eats of this a stoppage
of the bowels immediately takes place. A horse
at Berge, below there, was burst in this way not
long ago.”</p>

<p>[The reader may remember that a similar account
was given me last year on the Sogne-fjeld].<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>We had now emerged from the thickets, and,
after crossing a <i>mauvais pas</i> of slippery rock,
touched the snow after four hours’ hard walking.
The glare of the sun on the snow was rather trying
to the eyes, I congratulated myself that I was
not shadowless, like Peter Schlemil, as it was a
great relief to me to cast my vision on my own
lateral shadow as we proceeded. It was first-rate
weather, and the air being northerly, the snow was
not very slushy. The German painter ought to
be here. He told me his <i>forte</i> is winter landscape.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the grave-faced Jörgen, who was
at bottom a very good sort of intelligent fellow,
“look due east, sir, over where the Sör fjord lies.
Yonder is the Foss (waterfall) of Skeggedal, or
Tussedal, as some folks call it.”</p>

<p>As I cast my eyes eastward, I saw the highest
top of the Hardanger Fjeld, which I traversed last
year; my old friend Harteigen very conspicuous
with his quaint square head rising to the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
5400 feet, while his grey sides contrasted with the
Storfond to the south and the dazzling white
Tresfond and Jöklen to the north.</p>

<p>Straight in a line between myself and Harteigen
I now discerned a perpendicular strip of gleaming
white chalked upon a stupendous wall of dark rock.
That is Skeggedals foss. It falls several hundred
feet perpendicularly, but no wonder it looks a mere
thread from here, for it is more than fourteen miles
off as the crow flies.</p>

<p>“There are three falls at the head of the valley,”
continued Jörgen. “Two of them cross
each other at an angle quite wonderful to see.
They are called Tusse-straenge (Fairy strings).”</p>

<p>Wonderful music, thought I, must be given forth
by those fairy strings, mayhap akin to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent5">“The unmeasured notes</div>
<div class="verse">Of that strange lyre whose strings</div>
<div class="verse">The genii of the breezes sweep.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Tussedal is a terribly stügt (ugly) dale,” went
on Jörgen, “so narrow, and dark, and deep.
A little below those three waterfalls the river enters
into the ground, and disappears for some distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and than comes out again. We call that the
Swelge (swallow). Just below that there is a great
stone that has fallen across the chasm. It’s just
like a bridge: I’ve stood on that stone and looked
down many, many ells deep into the water boiling
below. Ay! that’s an ugly dale&mdash;a very ugly
dale. It’s not to be matched in Norway. You
ought to have gone to see it; but now I think of
it, it’s difficult to get to the falls, for there
is a lake to cross, and I think the old boat is stove
in now.”</p>

<p>After passing one or two crevasses (spraekker),
which become dangerous when the fresh snow
comes and covers them over, we at length arrive at
the first skiaer (skerry), a sort of Grand Mulets of
bare jagged crag, on which the snow did not seem
to rest. After lunching here, and drinking a mixture
of brandy and ice, we descend a slope of snow
by the side of a deep turquoise-coloured gutter, of
most serpentine shape, brimful of dashing water.
Just beyond this a sight met our eyes never to be
effaced from my memory. Far to the westward
the ocean is distinctly visible through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
film of haze rising from the snow, just thick
enough, like the crape on those veiled Italian
statues, to enhance its beauty. Between us and
the sea, purple ranges of mountains intersect each
other, the furthermost melting into the waves.
At right angles to these ranges is the Mauranger
Fjord, to which we have to descend. There it lies
like a mere trough of ink, opening gradually into
the main channel of the branching Hardanger,
with the island of Varald lying in the centre of it.
Over this to the north-west lies Bergen. To the
southward, skirting the Mauranger, is a cleft rock,
like the Brèche de Roland in the Pyrenées, while
between it and us may be seen the commencement
of the great Bondehus glacier.</p>

<p>Look! the smooth, sloping, snow-covered ice has
suddenly got on the <i>qui vive</i>. It’s already on the
incline, no drag will stop it; see how it begins to
rise into billows and fall into troughs, like the
breakers approaching the sea-shore; and yonder
it disappears from view between the adamantine
buttresses that encroach upon its sweep. To our
right is another pseudo glacier hanging from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
higher ascent like a blue ball-cloak from the
shoulder of a muslin-frocked damsel.</p>

<p>The <i>rochers montonnées</i> on which we stand
tell tales of that mysterious ice-period when the
glacier ground everything down with its powerful
emery, while by a curious natural convulsion,
a crevasse as broad and nearly as deep as the Box
cutting&mdash;not of ice but of rock, as if the very
rocks had caught the infection, and tried to split
in glacial fashion&mdash;strikes down to a small black
lake dotted with white ice floes.</p>

<p>It was indeed a wondrous scene. As we looked
at it, one of my companions observed, one could
almost imagine this was the exceeding high mountain
whence Satan shewed our Saviour all the
kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. As
if to make the thing stranger still, on one of the
bleached rocks are carved what one might easily
suppose were cabalistic letters, the records of an
era obscured in the grey mists of time, but which
it is beyond our power to decipher. Above us the
sky was cloudless, but wore that dark tinge which
as clearly indicates snow beneath as the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
ice-blink of the Arctic regions tells tales to the
voyager of a frozen ocean ahead.</p>

<p>“Now were off the Fond,” said Jörgen. “You
laughed at me when I asked you if you had a
compass. We’ve made short work of it to-day, but
you don’t know what it is when there is a skodda
(scud) over Folgo. Twenty-five years ago five
Englishmen, who tried to come over with five
horses, lost their way in the mist, and had hard
work to get back. Why it’s only fourteen days
since that I started with three other guides and
four Englishmen, but we were forced to return.
At this end of the passage there is one outlet, and
if you miss that it is impossible to get down into
the Mauranger.”</p>

<p>I found he was right; for, after worming our
way for a space through a hotch-potch of snow and
rocks, we suddenly turned a sharp corner, and
stood in a gateway invisible a moment before, from
whence a ladder of stone reached down to the
hamlet of Ovrehus, at the head of the Fjord, four
thousand feet below us.</p>

<p>“Four years ago,” said Jörgen, “I guided a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
German state-councilor across the Fond. How
he did drink brandviin! I think it was to give
him courage. He had a bottle full when he
started, and he kept pouring the spirits on to
lumps of sugar, and sucking them till the bottle
got quite empty and he quite drunk. We could
not get him a step further than this, and night was
coming on. I had to go down to Ovrehus, and
get four men with lanterns, and at last we got
him down at two o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>Jörgen thought the traveller was a German, but
I suspect if the real truth were known, it must
have been our friend the Danish Count, whose
propensity for drink and other peculiarities have
been recorded in the <i>Oxonian in Norway</i>. The
descent was uncommonly steep, even in the opinion
of one of my companions, who had ascended the
Col du Géant, and the stiffest passes in the
Tyrol.</p>

<p>After descending in safety, we entered a belt of
alder copse-wood. In one part of this the ground
had been ploughed up, and the trees torn away
and smashed right and left, as if some huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
animal had rushed through it, or rather, as if two
or three Great Western locomotives had run off
the line and bolted across country. What could it
be! The gash, I found, reached to a torrent of fierce
snow-water, in the centre of which a rock of a
great many tons weight had come to an anchor.
This was the <i>corpus delicti</i>. Looking at the cliffs,
I could discern several hundred feet above me the
mark of a recent dislocation, whence the monster
had started. The rupture had occurred only two
or three days before. What a grand sight it must
have been.</p>

<p>After a very sharp walk of eleven hours in all, we
entered a small farm-house. No less than eighteen
persons, from the sucking infant to the old woman
of eighty-four, surrounded us, as we dipped our
wooden spoons into a round tub of sour milk, the
only refreshment the place afforded. Red stockings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and blue caps, with an inner one of white,
and red bodices, were the chief objects that caught
my eye. The ventilation soon became so defective
from the crowd, that I got up and succeeded in
pushing open a wooden trap-door in the centre of
the roof by a pole attached to it. The apartment, in
fact, was one of the old “smoke rooms,” described
elsewhere, and the orifice, the ancient chimney
and window in one, which had been superseded
by a modern window and chimney in two. “That’s
an awkward place to cross, is that Folgo,” said a big
fellow to me. “My grandfather, who lived in
Sörfjord, where you come from, was to marry a lass
at Ovrehus here. On the day before the wedding
he started, with thirteen others, to cross Folgo.
Night came, but the party did not arrive. But no
harm was done, you see, sir; for I’m his grandson,
and if he had been lost I should not have seen the
light. [This pleasantry seemed to tickle the crowd.]
They did, however, stop all night on the snow, and
it was not till next day that they got down.”</p>

<p>From these people I find that there is no foundation
for the statement in “Murray,” that a band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of peasants lost their lives in crossing the snow.
The nearest approach to an accident is that detailed
above.</p>

<p>Next morning we take boat for the entrance of
the Bondehus valley, which debouches on the
Fjord half a mile from this, and opposite to which,
across the Fjord, is a place called Fladebo, from
which Forbes ascended the Folgefond by a much
easier path than that we had taken. Indeed, as we
loll easily in the boat, and look back at the descent
of yesterday, it seems astonishing how we ever
could get down at all. Landing at Bondehus,
after an hour’s walk up the valley, which was occupied
for some distance by meadows, in which
peasants were at work making hay, we reached a
lake, across which we row. By the stream, which
here shot into the further side of the lake,
there were a couple of water ouzels, bobbing
about.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s an Elv-Konge (river king), or, as
some call him, Foss-Konge (king of the waterfall),”
said our guide.</p>

<p>In spite of the apparent proximity of the glacier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it still took us several minutes’ climb before we
reached its foot.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the bad fare exhibited by Margareta
Larsdatter Ovrehus, was bad travelling on,
and made me rather exact in distances to-day. Passing
through a birch-grove, full of blue-berries
and cloud-berries of delicious taste, we found the
glacier only about thirty yards in front of us. The
shingly space which intervened was traversed by
four or five breastworks of loose sand and stones,
about ten feet in height. These are the moraines
left by the retreating glacier, so that at one time
the ice and the birch-copse must have touched.
Indeed, on either side of the glacier the trees may
be seen holding their ground close by the ice, loth,
apparently, to be separated from their opposite
brethren by the intervention of such an unceremonious
intruder.</p>

<p>We scrambled over the loose ramparts, and going
close under the glacier where a muddy stream came
forth, we discovered a huge cave, cut out of a blue
wall of ice, some sixty feet in height. Some of the
superincumbent mass had evidently just fallen in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
causing, perhaps, the roar which we had heard as
we ascended the valley. It was rather dangerous
work entering the cavern, as another fall might
take place, and I had no ambition to be preserved
after the manner of the Irish salmon for the London
market. But it was not every day that one
is privileged to enter such a magnificent hall, so in
I went alone. It was lit, too, by a lantern in the
roof, in other words, by a perfectly circular hole,
drilled through the crown of the arch, through
which I saw the sky overhead. Nothing could
exceed the intense depth of blue in this cool
recess.</p>

<p>But let us come and look a little more at the
stupendous scene above. Far up skyward, at a
distance of perhaps six English miles, though it
looks about one, is the pure cold level snow
of the Folgefond, glistening between two mighty
horns of shivered rock, that soar still higher
heavenward.</p>

<p>These two portals contract the passage through
which pours the great ice ocean; so that the monstrous
billows are upheaved on the backs of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
another in their struggle onward, and tower up into
various forms.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” said one of my companions, “it
looks just like a city on a hill side, Lyons, for
instance. Look yonder, there are regular church
towers and domes, and pinnacles and spires, and
castellated buildings, only somehow etherialized.
Why, there’s the arch of a bridge, you can see
right under it at the buildings beyond.”</p>

<p>“If Macaulay’s New Zealander were there,”
remarked I, “he would behold a grander sight than
ever he will on London Bridge when the metropolis
of the world is in ruin.”</p>

<p>“Ruin!” rejoined the poetical son of Erin,
“that’s already at work here. Look at this hall
of ice which has come down to-day. Ah! it’s
quite melancholy to think how all this splendid
vision, these cloud-capped towers, these glorious
palaces of silver and aquamarine, are moving on
insensibly, day by day, to their destruction, and
will melt away, not into air, but into dirty water,
by the time they reach the spot where we’re standing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>We had some hours of boating before night-fall,
so that we were forced to tear ourselves from
the scene, not forgetting to have a good look first
at a feature in it not yet mentioned&mdash;a magnificent
waterfall, which descended from the cliffs on the
left. So now adieu to the mountains. I shall
climb no more this year. Positively I feel as
downcast as the hot-brained youth of Macedon
when no more worlds were left for him to
conquer.</p>

<p>We were soon at the farm-house near the sea,
where Ragnhild Bondehus, with her red stockings,
blue polka-jacket and red boddice, looking quite
captivating, albeit threescore-and-ten, put before
us porridge and goat’s milk, which we devoured
with keen glacial appetite.</p>

<p>“How is the harvest looking where you came
from?” asked she, with anxious looks. This was
a question that had been frequently asked me this
summer.</p>

<p>“Very good all over Europe.”</p>

<p>“To God be praise and thanks!” she ejaculated.
“We shan’t have corn then too dear to buy. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
did hear that there was no grain sown in Denmark
this year; that’s not true, is it?”</p>

<p>The old lady derived no small comfort from my
assurance that this must be a fabrication of some
interested person.</p>

<p>Our boatmen landing with their great provision
boxes to dine at the rocky point where we reach
the main Hardanger, we land and examine one of
those singular “fixings” for catching salmon,
called a laxe-stie, or salmon ladder. It consists of
a high stage, projecting on a light scaffolding into
the water. In front of this, under the water, is
an oblong square of planks, painted white, from
twenty to thirty feet long and six broad. This is
kept at the bottom by great stones. Beyond this,
and parallel with the shore, several yards out, is
a fixed wall-net, to guide the fish into a drag-net,
one end of which is fastened to the shore, the
other sloped out to seaward. The dark-backed
salmon, which in certain places are fond of hugging
the shore, as they make for the rivers to spawn,
swim over the white board, and are at once seen
by the watcher perched on the stage above, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he speedily drags in the net set at right angles to
the shore, with the fish secure in the bag. In
some places the rock close by is also painted
white<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to attract the fish, who take it for a waterfall.
The man lodges in a little den close by, his
only escape from hence being most likely his boat,
drawn into a crevice of the sheer rocks around
him. Sometimes from twelve to twenty fish are
taken in this manner in a day. St. Johann’s-tid
(Midsummer) is the best time for taking them.
The season is now over, and the solitary sentinel
off to some other occupation.</p>

<p>According to the boatmen’s account, who, however,
are very lazy fellows, the stream is hard
against us; indeed, it always sets out in the
Hardanger from the quantity of river water that
comes into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah!” said Ole, “that’s called Streit-Steen
(Struggle-Stone). Satan once undertook to tow
a Jagt from Bergen up the Hardanger. He had
tough work of it, but he got on till he reached
that stone; then he was dead beat, and banned
and cursed dreadfully. It was he who called it
Streit-Steen.”</p>

<p>The less said about the poisonous beer and bad
food at Jondal, where we slept that night, the
better.</p>

<p>We cross over, early next morning, to Vikör.
The elder boatman, seventy-nine years old, was a
strange little, dried-up creature, dressed in a suit
of dark-green, the ancient costume of Jondal. One
of the party told him if he were to see him in
the gloaming he should take him for a Tuss.
Anyhow he had a great aversion to the priest,
against whose profits he declaimed loudly.</p>

<p>“Only to think,” said he, “the parson got tithe
of butter and calf-skins&mdash;yes, actually got a hundred
and fifteen calf-skins every year, worth half-a-crown
each, from Jondal alone!”</p>

<p>How beautiful the placid Fjord looked as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
pulled up the smiling little estuary to Vikör, and
gradually opened behind us the end of the great
Folgefond peninsula!</p>

<p>Near Vikör is the famed Östudfoss, said to be
the most picturesque waterfall in Norway. At
all events, it is a very eccentric one. The stream,
which at times is of immense volume, shooting
from the well shrubbed cliff above, which projects
considerably, makes a clear jump over a plot of
green turf, on which a dozen people or more could
stand without being wetted; in fact, right inside
the fall. While I stood within this crystal palace,
one of my Hibernian friends, who had approached
the spot by another route, clambering up the
rocks, mounted on to the platform,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Faith, and I’ve earned the pot of gold!” exclaimed
he, breathless with exertion.</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Why, did ye never hear the proverb&mdash;‘If
you catch hold of the rainbow you will get a pot
of gold?’ Ye never saw such a thing; just below
there, where the stream makes a shoot, I put me
hand right into a rainbow&mdash;yes, clean into it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>On our return we overtook a number of women,
dressed in their best. The inventory is as follows:
A lily-white, curiously-plaited head-dress, the
“getting-up” of which must take an infinity
of time and trouble; red or parti-coloured bodice,
black gown, and stockings of the same colour, cut
off at the ankle, while on the foot were white
socks with red edging, and shoes with high leather
insteps, such as were worn in the days of the
Cavaliers. By their side were a lot of children,
also in their best attire.</p>

<p>“Where are you all going to this fine day?”</p>

<p>“It’s vaccination (bole, an Icelandic word)
day, and we are all going to meet the doctor,
who will be here from Strandebarm by two
o’clock. We must all of us get a bolen-attest
(certificate of vaccination). That’s the King’s
order.”</p>

<p>The merchant’s establishment supplied us with
some tolerable Madeira wherewith to drink to our
next merry meeting, and my Irish friends, who
were pressed for time, took boat that afternoon for
Graven.</p>

<p>That evening and the next day (Sunday) I spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
under the hospitable roof of the parson of the
district. His house is beautifully situate on a
nook of the Hardanger, with a distant view of the
Folgefond.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, “it won’t be so difficult to
explore the beauties of our Fjords for the future.
Our Storthing, I see, by the last Christiania
papers, has voted several thousand dollars for
setting up steamers on this and the Romsdal
Fjord, which are to stop at the chief places. The
abrogation of Cromwell’s Navigation Act has done
great things for Norge’s commerce, and brought
much money into the country.”</p>

<p>“Norway is getting richer,” said I, “no doubt,
if one is to judge from the increase in the price of
living.”</p>

<p>“That may be caused in some measure by the
increase of capital, but the chief cause is another,
though it, too, lies at England’s door. We used
to get a great deal of butter, cheese, meal, and
meat from Jutland, but now, since the English
steamers run regularly thither, and carry off all the
surplus provisions, that source of supply is
stopped, and the articles of food are dearer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“That would not affect us much up here,”
put in the Frua (priest’s lady); “No, no; it is
the travelling English that do the mischief. Last
year, sir, when I and my husband went up to see
the Vöring foss, everything was so dreadfully dear,
we said we must never venture out on another
summer trip. And then, only think, there was an
English lord there with his yacht, who saw a pig
running on the shore, and said he would have the
pig for dinner cost what it might. It was quite a
small one, and they charged him six dollars. Yes,
it positively makes us tremble, for you know we
parson’s wives have not a great deal of money,
though we have good farms.”</p>

<p>“At all events, I can’t be charged with this sort
of folly,” said I; “for I resisted the extortions of
the merchant at Jondal.”</p>

<p>“What, he! he is one of the Lesere, and is considered
a very respectable man.”</p>

<p>“But will play the rogue when he thinks it won’t
be talked of,” rejoined I. “Shams and realities
are wonderfully alike. Do you know, even that
black-coated biped, the ostrich, can make a roar
just like a lion’s?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>As I crossed over from my bed-room next morning
to the main building, I found the grass-plot in
front of the house thronged by peasants who had
come to church, while in the centre of them was the
priest in his Lutheran cloak and elaborate frill.
The washing and starching of one of these ruffs
costs a shilling. The widow of a clergyman in
Bergen is a great adept in getting them up, and it
is no uncommon thing for them to come to her by
steamer from a distance of one hundred and forty
English miles.</p>

<p>The congregation were in church when I entered
with the ladies. We sat altogether in a square
pew on a level with the chancel dais. This mingling
of the sexes, however, was not permitted, of
course, among the primitive bonders: the men
being on one side of the interior, the women on
the other, reminding me of the evening parties in
a famous University town. The former wore most
of them short seamen’s jackets, though a few old
peasants adhered to the antique green coat of singular
cut, while their grey locks, which were parted
in the centre of the forehead, streamed patriarchally
over their shoulders, shading their strongly-marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
countenances. The female side was really very
picturesque. The head-dress is a white kerchief,
elaborately crimped or plaited, but by some
ingenious contrivance shaped in front somewhat
like the ladies’ small bonnets of the present day,
with one corner falling gracefully down behind, like
the topping of the Carolina ducks on the water in
St. James’s Park. Another part of this complicated
piece of linen, which is not plaited, covers the
forehead like a frontlet, almost close down to the
eyebrows, so that at a distance they looked just
like so many nuns. Nevertheless, they were the
married women of the audience. The spinsters’
head-dress was more simple. They wore no cap
at all. The back hair, which is braided in two
bands or tails with an intermixture of red tape, is
brought forward on either side of the head and
round the temples just on a level with the front
hair. For my part, I much admired the clean
and classic cut which some of their heads
exhibited in consequence. Most of the females
wore tight-fitting scarlet bodices edged with green.</p>

<p>On either side of their bosom were six silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
hooks, to hold a cross chain of the same metal.
The snow-white sleeves of the chemise formed a
conspicuous feature in the sparkling parterre. One
woman wore a different cap from the rest: its
upper part was shaped just like a glory, or
nimbus; this is done by inserting within a light
piece of wood of that shape. Her ornaments, too,
were not plain silver, but gilt. She was from
Strandebarm, which I passed yesterday on the
Fjord, the scene of a celebrated national song&mdash;“Bonde
i Bryllups Gaarden.”</p>

<p>Much psalm-singing prevailed out of Bishop
Kingo, of Funen’s, psalm-book. The priest then
read the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, with the
traditional, I suppose, but what sounded to me
very frightful, intonation. The sermon was not
extempore.</p>

<p>“He is a tolerable preacher,” said a peasant,
with quite the “Habitans in sicco” tone of criticism,
“but it is out of a book, and not out of his
hoved (head), like priest So-and-so, on the other
side of the Fjord.”</p>

<p>Very small and very red babies, not many hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
old,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I believe&mdash;such is the almost superstitious
eagerness with which these good folk rush to have
that sacred rite administered&mdash;were now brought to
be christened. No font was visible; there was, however,
an angel suspended by a cord from the roof,
with deep, flesh-coloured legs and arms, and a gilt
robe. In its right hand was a bowl, in its left a
book. The glocker, or clerk, a little man in a
blue sailor’s jacket, here dispatched a girl for some
water, which was brought, and poured into the
bowl, and the ceremony proceeded; which being
concluded, the angel was pulled up again midway
to the ceiling.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest then examined some young men and
women, who stood on either side of the aisle,
he walking up and down in the intervals of the
questions.</p>

<p>As we left the church a characteristic sight presented
itself. The churchyard was just the spot
in which one would like to be buried&mdash;a beautiful
freshly-mown sward, sloping down to the sea, and
intersected by a couple of brooks brawling down
from the hills, extended upwards to the copse of
hazel, aspen, ash, and rowan trees that fringed the
heights. Under some of these trees sat two or three
maidens, looking as stiff as Norwegian peasant girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
only can, when busked in their best, and before
a crowd of people. Nor was a view of the placid
fjord wanting. Look, some of the church-goers
are already in their boats, the red bodices and
white sleeves conspicuous from afar, while the
dripping oars flash in the sun.</p>

<p>Before I took leave of my host and his agreeable
family, I presented one of them, who was studying
English, with a volume of Bulwer’s. The parting
glass, of course, past round&mdash;a sacred institution,
the Afskedsöl of the Sagas.</p>

</div>

<p>Passing the Östudfoss, I struck straight up
Steindalen, purposing to pass a place called
Teigen, and thence over to the Samnanger Fjord,
on my road to Bergen. My hulking guide,
Thorsten Thormundson, who, from his height,
had been chosen as the front man of his regiment,
was but a poor fellow notwithstanding. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
started later than we ought, we did not reach our
destination before dark; and as there was not the
smallest vestige of a path through the morasses, we
had nearly walked over a cliff into a lake before I
was aware of our danger. Luckily, we at last found
a cot, and a boy conducted us to our destination.</p>

<p>After an uncomfortable night in a miserable
hole of a cottage, I received the agreeable intelligence
from my attendant, that he did not know
the way any further, and wished to leave me. I
informed him that he was quite welcome to do so,
but if he did, he must go minus all pay. Upon
this, the giant put on a very martial air, but seeing
that I was not to be bullied, he prepared for the
journey, employing a little maiden to show the
way.</p>

<p>It was lucky for us that he did so, for the road
was intricate beyond description. The old St.
Giles’s rookery may serve as a comparison, for
want of a better one. Being ahead, I was marching
straight forward, when I was recalled by the
shrill voice of the bare-footed lassie.</p>

<p>“On there,” she said, “was a precipice, over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which Brat-foss poured. There was not foot-hold
for a goat that way. We must try and get
through the bog to the left, and so round by
Raune bottom.”</p>

<p>It was a bottom indeed&mdash;cliffs all round, with a
treacherous swamp and streams flowing all manner
of ways; and then came another descent, the girl
leading the pony, and the man pulling hard at its
tail by way of drag.</p>

<p>The progress was so slow that I sat down, from
time to time, to look about me. In one place I
found I was close upon a great ant-hill, a yard
high, from whence I perceived a regular line was
formed to a neighbouring pine-tree. Up the bole
of this a number of these industrious insects were
ascending and descending with most exemplary
perseverance; though I could not see that, either
going or returning, they went otherwise than
empty away. I tapped the tree with my stick,
when in the twinkling of an eye the ascending and
descending squadrons put themselves in a posture
of defence; that is to say, each of them threw
itself on its back, with its head reared up, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
tail protruded. In a moment or two, when all was
quiet, they, as if by signal, unfixed their bayonets,
and recommenced their march.</p>

<p>In another part of our round-about walk I sat
down by a stream side, and began making rainbows&mdash;yes,
rainbows. The sun shone straight up the
valley, and the wind was blowing in the same
direction. I threw a stone into the clear torrent
right among some watching trout, and from the
spot where it struck an iris immediately threw out
its tricoloured arch athwart the stream, slowly
disappearing as the spray, upheld for a second or
two by the wind, again subsided on the water.</p>

<p>If my friend the Irishman was to find a pot of
gold for getting hold of the rainbow, what luck
was in store for me who had actually made one?
But the augury was a treacherous one, as we shall
see.</p>

<p>Following the stream, which abounded in most
captivating looking holes, to my piscatorial eye, we
at length reach the farm of Tyssen, whence a beautiful
view is obtained across the head of the Samnanger
Fjord, with the church of Samnanger lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
under the mountains at the further side. As bad
luck would have it, not a soul was at home. The
only biped I saw was a statuesque heron standing
on a stone by the boat-house. What was to be
done? It was my object to obtain a boat here
and sail down the Fjord to Hatvigen, where I
should be on the great coast road, and not many
miles from Bergen.</p>

<p>In this dilemma I descried a little man emerge
from the quern, or corn-mill, which stood at the
bottom of the stream, near some salmon traps.
Perhaps he was only the mill-goblin, but at any
rate I would hail him. He took no notice. It
must be the Quern knurre. But perhaps the noise
of the stream rushing over the rocks into the Fjord
drowned my voice, and prevented it being heard;
so I and the loutish Thorsten clubbed lungs, when
the figure looked round, and immediately walked
away. Mr. Thorsten Thormundson wished to be
off and leave me to my fate; but I positively forbid
him to move until we had discovered some means
of conveyance. Presently the small figure reappeared,
accompanied by a female figure. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
hailed again, and this time the mannikin walked to
a boat and came across to us. He was a poor
peasant from the mountains, who had been buying
a sack of corn for four dollars three marks, which
would serve him and three mouths till “Michelsmass,”
and he and his wife had come hither to
grind it. The grinding must be finished, and the
meal carried up to his distant home before night.
Nevertheless he would row me, he said, half a
Norwegian mile, where he thought I might get
another boatman.</p>

<p>When we had rowed some distance we descry
some people making hay on the lea.</p>

<p>“Would they row me?”</p>

<p>“Had no time. But they had a husman in a
cottage hard by, who perhaps could do it.”</p>

<p>My man landed, and went in search of the said
husman. A tiny little man in rags, much smaller
than the mill-goblin, with a very tiny voice, and a
still more tiny boy, appear and undertake the job,
provided I give him time to have some mad (meat)
first. Although the boat was very leaky, and
though at one place we encountered a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
swell from the effects of a gale out at sea, we
manage by night-fall to reach Hatvigen.</p>

<p>On the road we meet a boat full of boys and
girls, who have been several miles to be examined
by the clergyman for confirmation. We little
know the hardships to which these people are subject.
Only a few days ago, a boat similarly laden,
and on a similar errand, was upset by a sudden
squall, and about a dozen unfortunate young people
drowned.</p>

<p>Nothing particular caught my eye next day, as
I drove along the coast to Bergen, beyond the new
telegraphic line which is just completing to Bergen.
Some of the posts are the growing pine-trees,
which happen to stand ready fixed for the
purpose. Another telegraphic cable is making for
a part of the coast to advertize people of the approach
of the herrings. This will be the future
sea-serpent of the country.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to sleep that night under the
roof of Madame Sontum at Bergen. Next day,
under the auspices of a German physician, I visit
the Leper Hospital on the hill above the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
It is a magnificent building of wood, lately constructed
by the State, at an expense of sixty thousand
dollars, and kept up from the same source,
private donations being unusual. Three years ago
the old hospital was burned down at dead of night,
and eight unfortunates were consumed. The present
spacious building can accommodate two hundred
and eighty patients; at present there are
only one hundred and eighty inmates. In the
Jörgen Spital there are one hundred and thirty,
and a few in another hospital in the town. This
disease is generally supposed to be incurable.
About twenty-five per cent. die in the course of the
year. The chaplain, a burley, good-looking man,
was in his canonicals, and about to bury a recently
deceased patient on our arrival; he descanted on
the horrors of the place.</p>

<p>With these I became personally acquainted on
the arrival of Dr. L&mdash;&mdash;, the physician of the
establishment.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, if you please,” said that functionary,
putting on a blouse of black serge; “but
I warn you it is a terrible sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, thought I to myself, I will go notwithstanding.
The best antidote to the imaginary
ills of this life, is to become acquainted with the
real ones.</p>

<p>Walking along the spacious corridors, we first
entered a room devoted to male cases. Here, as in
all the other rooms, there were six beds. I conversed
with one man. This case was not yet at a
bad stage. He had suffered much hardship in his
youth as a seaman, was often wet, and badly fed
withal. By dint of industry, he became owner of
a jagt, and he said he hoped to get out again and
be well enough to take the command of it.</p>

<p>Another man in a bed close by was affected with
the smooth leprosy. He attributed it to his having
slept in the same bed with a man affected with
the disease. He was worn to the bone, and his
face and body were blotched and copper-coloured.
But before pursuing our melancholy walk, I will
just glance at a small tract which has been published
by the Government in respect to this foul
and mysterious disease, which, after having been
driven out of the other countries of Europe, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
holds its ground on the sea-coast of Norway, especially
from Stavanger northwards.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of leprosy, which are so
very dissimilar in their outward symptoms, that
one would hardly imagine that they are the same
disease; the one is called the knotted leprosy, the
other the smooth leprosy. The first indications of
the poison being in the system are lassitude and
stiffness in the limbs. The body feels unusually
heavy and disinclined to exertion. Sharp pains
rack the frame, especially when it is warm, or
on the eve of a change of weather. Cold shudderings
also supervene, succeeded presently by
fever; together with pains in the head, thirst and
loss of appetite. All this is accompanied by
general listlessness and depression of spirits.
Another symptom is a strong inclination to sleep,
though sleep brings no refreshment to the limbs.</p>

<p>In knotted leprosy, red spots and sores break
out upon the body, especially on the face, which
becomes much swollen. These are not accompanied
with pain, and often disappear again;
but with a new attack of fever they re-appear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
at last become permanent. They now grow larger
and larger&mdash;some of the knots attain the size of a
hazel nut&mdash;and are generally of a yellow-brown
colour, with occasionally a tint of blue. They are
most frequent on the arms, hands, and face, but
most of all about the eyebrows, which fall off in
consequence. After a period of time&mdash;which is
shorter or longer as the case may be&mdash;pain is felt
in these knots, and they then either turn into
regular sores, or become covered with a brown
crust. The eyes, mouth, and throat are next attacked,
and the eye-sight, breathing and swallowing
are affected.</p>

<p>In smooth leprosy, the symptoms are large
blisters and white spots, together with great pain
and tenderness in various parts of the body.
These vesicles are from the bigness of a hazel-nut
to that of a hen’s egg, and are filled with a watery
fluid. They are situated about the elbows and
knees, occasionally under the sole of the foot, and
elsewhere, and soon burst. The spots, which in
the smooth leprosy occur on the body, are not
brown, as in the knotted leprosy, but white, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a larger size, sometimes being as big as a man’s
hand; they are covered with white scales. The
pain and tenderness which occur in this kind of
leprosy gradually disappear, and are followed by
utter absence of feeling. At this stage fire or the
knife can be applied to the parts diseased without
the patient feeling it in the least. A large
portion of the body can be thus affected. The
patient now begins to get thin, his skin is dry, and
his countenance distorted. He can’t shut his eyes,
and he is not able to bring his lips together, so as
to cover the teeth; besides this, the toes and fingers
become contracted and rot off.</p>

<p>Curiously enough symptoms of both these
horrible phases of a most loathsome disorder occur
in one and the same person; in that case the
knotted leprosy occurs first, and the knots gradually
vanishing, the smooth leprosy supervenes.</p>

<p>This frightful malady has been ascertained to be
hereditary, that is to say, it can be transmitted by
either parent to their offspring. At first the
children seem to be quite healthy, but they conceal
within their system the hidden germs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
complaint, which may at any time break out.
Sometimes such children never do betray the
presence of the poison, certain defective sanitary
conditions being necessary for its development.
But, notwithstanding, the disease may come out
in the third generation. The most favourable circumstances
for its development are an irregular
way of life, defective clothing, bad lodging or diet,
want of personal cleanliness, and mental anxiety.
Under such circumstances, persons who have no
hereditary tinge may take the complaint. It is not
contagious in the strict sense of the word, but
experience seems to show that persons who live in
intercourse with leprous persons are very prone to
become so themselves. A remarkable illustration
of this occurred in Nord-Fjord. The owners of a
gaard took the leprosy, and died. The farm was inherited
by another family, who became infected with
the disease, and died of it. A third family, who succeeded
to the dwelling, also perished of the malady.
On this, the owner of the house burnt it down.</p>

<p>The Government authorities finally recommend,
as a means of getting rid of this dreadful disease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
personal and household cleanliness, proper apparel
and lodging, wholesome diet (especially abstinence
from half-rotten fish), moderation, particularly in
the consumption of spirituous liquors; and, above
all, they deprecate intermarriage among those so
affected. The present number of lepers in Norway
is two thousand and fifty odd, or about one
in every seven thousand.</p>

<p>But to proceed with our walk through the
hospital. In another ward set apart for males,
I addressed a lump of what did not look like
humanity, and asked how old he was. The
answer was sixteen. He looked sixty. His voice&mdash;oh
heavens! to think that the human voice
divine could have become degraded to that hoarse
grating, snuffling sound, the dry husk of what it
ought to be!</p>

<p>Close by this case was a man whose face was
swollen immensely, and over the brows huge knots
and folds of a dark tint congregated together. His
face looked more like a knotted clump in the bole
of a tree than a human countenance. Sitting on a
bed in another room was a boy whose face was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
literally eaten through and through, and honeycombed
as if by malignant cancer. Nobody can
witness all this without realizing to himself more
completely the power of Him who could cure it
with a mere touch.</p>

<p>Crossing the passage, I saw a nice, pretty little
girl playing about.</p>

<p>“She is all right at present,” said the doctor,
“but both her sisters showed it at her age, and
her parents died of it. She is here to be taken
care of.”</p>

<p>On the women’s side, one of the first cases that
caught my attention was an old woman with the
septum of the nose gone, and groaning with intense
agony. Near her was a woman whose toes
and fingers had disappeared, and for the present the
complaint was quiescent. Indeed, one of the not
least frightful symptoms of the disease is, that after
a toe or finger is gone the sore heals up, but suddenly
breaks out afresh higher up the limb. Unlike
a person in an adjoining bed, who shrieked
out for fear she should be touched&mdash;so sensitive
was her flesh&mdash;this poor thing had lost all sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of feeling. When I touched her, at the doctor’s
request, she could feel nothing.</p>

<p>One blue-eyed girl, with a fair skin and well
combed hair, looked well in the face, but the
doctor said her body was in a terrible state.</p>

<p>As I walked round the room, I observed another
young woman, stretched on a bed in the corner,
with dark luxuriant hair&mdash;very un-Norwegian in
tint&mdash;and with peculiarly bright flashing eyes,
with which she gazed at me steadfastly.</p>

<p>“Come hither,” said the doctor to me; “shut
your eyes, Bergita.”</p>

<p>The poor thing gave a faint smile, and slightly
moved her lids; but this was all. She will never
shut those eyes again, perhaps, not even in death.</p>

<p>In another bed was a woman with her teeth
uncovered and lips apart.</p>

<p>“Now, mother, try and shut your lips.”</p>

<p>A tremulous movement of the lower jaw followed,
but the muscles would not work; the
disease had destroyed the hinges, and there she
lay, mouth open, a spectacle of horror.</p>

<p>In some cases&mdash;indeed, very many&mdash;when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
disease has seriously set in, it throws a white film
over the iris of the eye, the pupil becomes contracted,
the ball loses its colour, becomes a whitish
mass, and gradually rots out of the socket. Each
patient had a religious book by his side, and
some sat on the bed or by it reading. They all
seemed unrepining at their lot. One poor woman
wept tears of gladness when I addressed a word
or two of consolation to her. Indeed, the amount
of pain felt by these poor sufferers is very small
in comparison with what might have been expected
from the marks of the fell talons imprinted on their
frames. The doctor said they were chiefly carried
off at last by hectic fever. Scurvy ointment is used
in many cases, frequent cupping in others. One
poor woman, with a leg like an elephant’s, so deformed
and shapeless was it, declined amputation.
And there she will go on, the excessive sensitiveness
to pain succeeded by an utter anæsthetic state, and
one extremity rotting off after another, till she is
left a mere blotched trunk, unless a merciful death
relieve her before.</p>

<p>One poor woman had been afflicted for no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
than fifty years; her parents, if I remember rightly,
were free from the malady, but her grandfather and
grandmother had suffered from it. But we have
seen enough of this melancholy place. It is a
satisfaction to know that, at all events, although
the disease cannot be cured by medicine or any
other remedy, yet as much is done as possible to
alleviate its miseries. The surgeon and chaplain
are daily in attendance; abundance of active
young women&mdash;not old gin-drinking harridans&mdash;discharge
the office of nurses. The diet is much
better than these people would obtain at home. I
examined the spacious kitchens, and learned that
meat is served thrice a-week to the patients, not to
mention soups, puddings, &amp;c. It has been asserted
that the disease has lately been on the increase in
Norway, but this statement is based most likely on
insufficient data.</p>

<p>In the rest of Europe, Scotland especially, to
judge from all accounts, it was at one time as bad
as it is now in this country. Neither was it confined
to the lower classes. Robert Bruce died of
it. But as it is now almost, if not altogether,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
exterminated in Scotland, there seems no reason
why, if the advice of the Government above-mentioned
is followed, it should not also die out in
Scandinavia. In other respects, the population is
healthy and strong, and not affected by goître or
any of the usual mountain complaints.</p>

<p>We now took leave of the doctor; my friend, the
German physician, who was specially interested in
the effect produced on the sight by the disease,
appointed the next day for a microscopic examination
of some of the patients’ eyes in early stages of
the disorder. It may be as well to state that Professor
Danielson has published a work illustrating
by plates the progress of the disorder. Inoculation
is also about to be tried as a method of cure, it
having been used with success in this country in
another disease, many symptoms of which, to a
non-professional observer at least, are identical in
appearance with those above described.</p>

<p>“Farewell!” said the doctor; “I have shown
you a sad spectacle. I am sorry I can’t converse
with you in your own language. But the next
generation will all speak English. It has just been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
proposed in the Storthing that, in the middle
schools, less Latin shall be taught, and English
made a necessary branch of education.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Bergen I visited the museum,
under the auspices of the very obliging curator,
Dr. Korn.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of a new kind of starfish
(Beryx Borealis), discovered by Asbjörnsen. The
only habitat yet known of this animal is the
Sörfjord. The Glesner Regalicus was also here.
It is found in very deep water, and so rarely that,
in three hundred years, only two or three specimens
had been met with.</p>

<p>Some embryo whales of different degrees of
maturity were also preserved in spirits; specimens
of these delicate little monsters are not, I believe,
to be found in any other museum of Europe.
The Strix Funerea, or Hawk Owl, such as I shot
in the Malanger, with its beautiful black and
white plumage, was also to be seen. Especially
beautiful was the Anas Stellaris from beyond
the North Cape.</p>

<p>The usual assortment of old Runic calendars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and other mementoes of ancient days were not
wanting: not to mention one of those enigmatical
Jette gryde (fairy pots) with which the vulgar have
connected all sorts of stories. It is composed of two
parts, a mortar-shaped cavity in stone, and in this
a loose, round cannon-ball sort, also of stone. Here
were evidently cause and effect. A loose stone
happening to be brought by the stream into a depression
in the rocky bed of the torrent, by the action
of water becomes itself round, after the manner of a
marble, and makes its resting-place round too.
The countenances of people who live continually
together are often observed to become like. In
the same way the perforated and rounded stones
which are formed by trituration in the channels of
the brooks on the Scottish borders are still termed,
says Scott, by the vulgar, fairy cups and dishes.</p>

<p>Before leaving Bergen, I must not omit to
record an incident which really speaks much for
the good-nature of these people.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me, sir,” said I, accosting a jolly,
bearded gentleman, in the street, “which is the
best bookseller in Bergen?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; come this way, I will show you.”</p>

<p>We entered the shop of the bookseller, whose
snuffling, sobbing method of talk convinced me at
once that he was a Dane. The language is a
nerveless, flabby sing-song, gasped out with
bated breath. The Norwegian speaks out like a
man, and with a pith and marrow in his pronunciation
worthy of the rugged power with
which one always associates in idea the name of
Norway.</p>

<p>The pale bibliopole, after carefully shutting the
door, which I had purposely left open&mdash;so close
and oppressive was the atmosphere of the unventilated
shop&mdash;fumbled about for a little time,
and then discovered that the book I wanted was
out of print.</p>

<p>“Oh! never mind,” said the stranger, “I
have got a copy, which is very much at your
service.”</p>

<p>And in spite of my protestations, this amiable
gentleman, whom I afterwards discovered to be
Professor C&mdash;&mdash;, an author of some repute, conducted
me to his house, placed refreshments before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
me, and compelled me to take the book, the cost
of which was considerable. Indeed, all books in
Norway are very dear, which may account for the
fewness of readers.</p>

<p>Two matters of considerable importance stirred
Bergen to its innermost core while I was there.
What do you think they were, reader? Gas has
been introduced, and to-night is the first night of
lighting it. What a number of people are moving
about to see it, as we go on board the steamer
<i>Jupiter</i>, bound for Hamburg. The other incident
was productive of no less ferment. Ole Bull, the
prince of fiddlers, the Amphion of the American
wilds, sick apparently of combining the office of
leader of a colony, and musician-in-chief to the
new community, has just returned to this, his native
place, and is about to give a concert, to inaugurate
his assumption of his new office of director of the
Bergen Theatre.</p>

</div>

<p>In the old coaching days it used to be said the
safest day in the year to travel by the Tantivy was
the day after an upset. The same will hold good,
thought I, of steamers, as I heard an animated
conversation on board, how that last voyage it
was all but a case of <i>Norge</i> v. <i>Bergen</i> (alluding
to a collision between those two steamers, when the
former went down), and how the <i>Viken</i>, Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
steamer, would have been utterly cut down,
and sunk, had it not been for the presence of mind
of the <i>Jupiter</i> captain; how, moreover, a fierce
newspaper war was going on in consequence, and
the Government had ordered an inquiry.</p>

<p>Sooth to say, the navigation of this coast by
night is very dangerous. Lord Dufferin, I think,
says there are no lighthouses. He is wrong; there
are more than twenty. But what are these among
so many shoals, islands, narrow channels, ins and
outs, as this coast exhibits?</p>

<p>“Yonder,” said a Norwegian gentleman on
board, “is the Skratteskjaer (skerry of shrieks).”
This spot takes its name from a tragic event of
which it was the scene many hundred years
ago. Olaf the Holy, being resolved to get rid of
the Seidemaend (magicians and necromancers), who
then abounded in Norway, made a quantity of
them drunk, and, in that condition, set fire to the
house where they were assembled, and made a holocaust
of them. Eywind, however, a noted warlock,
escaped through the chimney-hole; but afterwards
he, with three hundred others, were caught, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
chained down on that skerry, which is covered at
high water. As the tide rose, the shrieks of the
victims pierced the air; but the royal executioner
was inexorable.</p>

<p>Crossing the mouth of the Buknfjord, we stopped
for half-an-hour at Stavanger, where I had an opportunity
of examining the cathedral, which really
exhibits some fine pieces of early Gothic. The nave
was built in 1115. The verger was profoundly
ignorant of all architecture, and so were some
Norwegian gentlemen who accompanied me. What
they chiefly attended to was a plaster model of
Christ, after Thorwaldsen, and some tasteless
modern woodwork. The pulpit is two hundred
years old.</p>

<p>We here shipped a deputy, on his way to
the Storthing now sitting at Christiania. He
was a very staid person, who evidently considered
that he was called upon to set the passengers
an edifying example of superior intelligence
and unmoved gravity. I heard that he
had formerly been a simple bonder, but was
now a thriving merchant. Perhaps I shall best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
describe him by saying that his parchment visage
reminded me of a Palimpsest, whence a secular
composition had been erased to make room for a
sanctimonious homily; but, at the corners of the
parchment, some of the old secular characters still
peeped out unerased. Next me, after dinner, sat a
sharp young Bergenser. To while away the time,
I asked him if he could recite me any popular
songs or rhymes. He responded to the call at
once, and produced a couple of broad sheets from
his pocket-book, containing two favourite old Norsk
ballads; one of which was the famed “Bonde i
Brylups Garen;” the other was, “The Courtship
of Ole and Father Mikkel’s Daughter.”</p>

<p>The deputy’s attention I observed to be caught
by our conversation, and he smiled gravely. Only
think of a Storthingsman, clad in a sober suit of
brown, whose mind was supposed to be full of the
important business of the country, listening to
such trifles. Gude preserve ye! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, what
childish stuff. Nevertheless, he had once been a
child, and a peasant-child, too; and there was a
time when he sat on the maternal knee, and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the lullabies of his country. Nay, he went so far
as to recite a country jingle himself. It was what
we call in England a Game rhyme. Seven children
are dancing round in a ring; suddenly the
ring is broken, and each one endeavours to seize a
partner.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He uttered this in a low tone of voice, as if he
was heartily ashamed of the infantine reminiscence.
Human nature shrunk again into itself; the deputy
remembered that his countrymen’s eyes were upon
him, and he must be careful of betraying any
further weakness of the sort. One or two Norwegians
who had overheard the conversation, looked
with no little astonishment at their representative,
and with a somewhat indignant expression of
countenance at me, doubtful, apparently, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
I had not of <i>malice prepense</i> been taking a rise out
of a Norwegian Storthingsman.</p>

<p>As we passed Jaederen’s Rev (reef), a long, low
flat shore of some miles in extent, we had the
usual storm, which stirred up the bilgewater to an
offensive degree, and in consequence thereof, the
wrath of a doctor on board, who wore yellow kids
and much jewellery, but who was not half a bad
fellow in spite of his foppery.</p>

<p>As I sat by the open window of the hotel, at
Christiansand, two burly fellows in the singular
Sætersdal costume, greeted me. In them I at once
recognised two peasants with whom I had had
speech at Valle. They had come down to meet the
new parson and his family, whom they would drive
up on the morrow on the way to his expectant
parishioners. The good fellows were mightily
pleased when I handed them some Bayersk Öl out
of the window. A Norwegian student who was
with me heard them deliberating whether they
should not treat the strange Carl to a glass of
something; but they apparently thought it would
be taking too great a liberty, and presently made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
their bow, carrying all sorts of greetings to my
friends in their distant home.</p>

<p>Next day I started to Moss, in the Christiania
Fjord, by the steamer of that name. She was built
in Scotland, and goes sixteen miles an hour, more
than double the pace of the Government steamers,
which are proverbially slow. Many of the Norwegians
are frightened of her, and say she will
break her back.</p>

<p>There was an intelligent young Norwegian on
board who is resident in America. He tells me
that the Lammers’ schism has done no little good,
in a religious point of view, by awaking the State
clergy from the torpor into which they had sunk;
and there is every symptom of a new spiritual life
being infused into the community. Things, he
says, have hitherto been at a low ebb in this
respect throughout the country. Among the
better classes there is no such thing as family
prayers, they seldom look at their Bibles. At
Arendal and Christiania private meetings have been
set on foot for prayer and reading of the Scriptures.
A Moravian clergyman, who was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
to establish gatherings of this kind, and who has
laboured diligently in this line for some years, has
lately received a subvention from the Government
without his solicitation.</p>

<p>In Sweden, the proposal to abolish the law
by which Dissenters may not reside in that
country, has lately been thrown out in the Chambers,
Count P&mdash;&mdash; having described in pathetic
language the danger likely to ensue upon such a
change, and being backed in his opposition by
280 clergy.</p>

<p>In Norway, on the contrary, as in England,
all religions, provided they do not trangress the
laws of morality and social order, are tolerated.
The Roman Catholics take advantage of this, and
are busy in a quiet way making proselytes. The
widow of the late King Bernadotte is understood
to give her countenance to their exertions. Contributions
are also received from Belgium and
France, and two French ladies conduct a school
on Romish principles at Christiania. One of
the two Romish priests there is a born Norwegian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>My travelling companion also informs me of a
curious discovery made lately by Lange, the
author of a <i>History of Norwegian Monasteries</i>.</p>

<p>It has always been supposed that the precious
treasures which adorned the tomb of St. Olaf, in
the Cathedral of Trondjem, were stolen by King
Christian the Second, and that the ship conveying
the ill-gotten booty sank near Christiansand.</p>

<p>At Amsterdam, however, from whence Lange
has just returned, he found incontestable documentary
evidence that the Archbishop of Trondjem
was himself the thief. He fled to Amsterdam,
got into debt, and the jewels were sold and dispersed.</p>

<p>Landing at Moss, I passed through a wretchedly
ugly country to Frederickshal. There is nothing in
the place worth seeing, except the fortress and the
statue to the patriotic burgher, Peder Colbjörnsen.
Some of the houses are far beyond the average of
many of the Norwegian towns; to which detracting
people might be inclined to apply the old description
of Granville:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Granville, grand vilain,</div>
<div class="verse">Une église, et un moulin,</div>
<div class="verse">On voit Granville tout à plein.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A small enclosure outside the fortress marks
the spot where the Swedish madman was sacrificed
by one of his own soldiers while occupied in
the siege. The monument, however, has utterly
disappeared. A new one is talked of.</p>

<p>Thence I posted to Sarpsborg, to see the mighty
falls of the Glommen, with the beautiful suspension-bridge
swung over them. Above it the huge
river winds away its vast coils into the distant
mountains, bringing down the timbers which once
grew upon their sides. But the wastefulness of
the people in timber is now beginning to tell.
Norway is at length about to start a Forstwesen
similar to that of Germany, and Asbjörnsen is now
employed by the Government in travelling through
Bavaria, for the purpose of investigating the admirable
regulations there in force in the Department
of Woods and Forests.</p>

<p>As usual, there has been a fire in Sarpsborg.
Half the town is destroyed, and presents a terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
scene of desolation.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A new church, just completed,
was saved by a miracle. At Drammen, on
the other side of the Fjord, one or two fires have
also been sweeping away a vast quantity of buildings.
The conflagration was visible at Uddevalla,
near Gottenburg, about one hundred and fifty
miles off.</p>

<p>My slumbers that night, at the waterside inn,
whence the steamer was to start next morning,
were interrupted by an odd sort of visitation. Two
bulky Norwegian gentlemen were ushered into the
bed-room, puffing away at cigars, and forthwith
prepared to occupy the other bed. By what Procrustean
process it could possibly be made to contain
two such ponderosities was a problem now to
be solved. However, one of them got in first, and
retreated as far as he could into its recesses. The
other followed, and managed to squeeze himself
into the space left by the side of his companion.
Many jocular remarks were let fall between them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and one remark especially seemed to tickle the
risibilities of the larger and fatter man to such an
extent that he shook again, and the bed also.
Suddenly I heard a loud smash, and looking up,
found that the bottom of the bed, though equal to
their dead weight in a quiescent state, was unable
to bear the momentum of their laughter-shaken
frames, and had given way, both gentlemen falling
through on to the floor.</p>

<p>For some time they had great difficulty in
escaping from their awkward predicament. This,
however, was at length effected, and for the rest of
the night the floor was their couch&mdash;the floor
which they had used as a spittoon; but this did
not seem in the least to interfere with their
comfort.</p>

<p>Having nothing to call me to the capital, I
determined to catch the Kiel steamer that afternoon
in the Christiania Fjord, where I saw for the first
time one of those remarkable mirages so common
in the seas of Scandinavia, which are supposed to
have given rise to the legends of phantom-ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
which prevail along the coast. The next day we
were steaming over a smooth sea, along the low
coast of our forefathers, the Jutes, and the day
after shot by train through the heathy flats whence
issued England’s sponsors, the Angles.</p>

preceded the Celts, who possessed settled abodes in
Europe 2000 years ago, by about a thousand years. The
“bronze” period must have prevailed in the early part
of the Christian era, when the Goths were inhabitants
of the country. The “iron” period can first be traced in
Norway and Sweden with any certainty in the fourth and
fifth centuries. In Denmark the use of iron superseded
the use of bronze altogether about 700 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> But it is
hardly necessary to observe, that there is still much controversy

about these heathen temples. On the door of that at
Lade, near Trondjem, was a massive gold ring. Olaf
Trygveson, when wooing Sigrid the Haughty, made her a
present of it. Having an eye to the main chance, she put it
in the hands of the Swedish goldsmiths to be tested (Becky
Sharp would not have done worse). They grinned knowingly.
The weight was due in a great measure to a copper
lining. No wonder after this that she flatly refused to be
baptized, the condition Olaf had laid down for wedding her.
Upon this he called her a heathen &mdash;&mdash;, and struck her on
the cheek with his glove. “One day this shall be thy
death,” she exclaimed. She kept her word. Through her influence
Sweyne was induced to war with Olaf, who lost

so here skrüb is a euphemism for wolf. The word
is evidently derived from skrübba, to scrub, and alludes
to the rough dressing or scrubbing to be expected at the
claws of that beast. This disinclination to use the real
name “ulv,” is no doubt due to the ancient superstition of
the “varulf” (wer-wolf).</p>

<p>See Grimm. <i>Deutsche Mythologie</i>, 1047. In the war of
1808 it was commonly believed in Sweden that those of
their countrymen who were made prisoners by the Russians
were changed by them into wer or were-wolves, and
sent home to plague their country. The classical reader
will remember the Scythian people mentioned by Herodotus,
who all and several used to turn wolves for
a few days in every year. The Swedes go still
further in their reluctance to call certain animals by their
real names. Not only do they call the bear <i>the old one</i>, or
<i>grandfather</i>, and the wolf <i>grey-foot</i>, but the fox is <i>blue-foot</i>,
or <i>he that goes in the forest</i>; the seal is <i>brother Lars</i>,
while such small deer as rats and mice are known
respectively as the <i>long-bodied</i> and the <i>small-grey</i>.</p>

edited a collection of Norsk minstrelsy, gathered from the
mouths of the people. Bugge is a student, who is travelling
about the remote valleys, at the expense of the
Government, to collect all the metrical tales and traditions
that still linger there. It is very unfortunate that this
was not done earlier. The last few years have made great
inroads on these reminiscences of days gone by.</p>

abroad in the fields, near his own house, he was suddenly
carried away, and found next day at Paris, in the French
king’s cellar, with a silver cup in his hand. Being brought
into the king’s presence, and questioned who he was, and
how he came thither, he told his name, country, and
place of residence; and that, on such a day of the month
(which proved to be the day immediately preceding), being
in the fields, he heard a noise of a whirlwind, and of
voices crying, ‘Horse and Hattock!’ (this is the word the
fairies are said to use when they remove from any place);
whereupon he cried, ‘Horse and Hattock’ also, and was
immediately caught up, and transported through the air
by the fairies to that place; where, after he had drank
heartily, he fell asleep; and, before he awakened, the rest
of the company were gone.”&mdash;<i>Letter from Scotland to
Aubrey, quoted by W. Scott.</i> I could not learn what the
<i>mot</i> of the fairy pack is in Sætersdal, or that there was
any at all. Still the Norsk superstition is clearly the
parent of the Scotch one.</p>

escape compulsory marriage with a heathen, she took ship,
and was driven by tempests on the Isle of Selia, near Stad,
in Norway, and, with her attendants, found shelter in a
cave. The heathens on the mainland, on the look-out for
windfalls, observed that there were people on the desert
island, and immediately put off to it. At this juncture,
through the prayers of Sunniva and her friends, the rocks
split, the cave became blocked up, and the savages drew
the island blank. In 1014, when Olaf Trygveson landed
here from Northumberland, breathing slaughter against
the pagans, he discovered the bones of Sunniva, and she
was at once canonized.</p>

in which Saint Olaf is said to have lodged. There was,
not long ago, a house at Naes, in Hallingdal, where the

with water, and give it a name. Thus Sigurd Jarl baptized
the infant of Thora, the wife of Harald Harfager, and called
it Hacon, although this had nothing to do with Christianity,
for this child was afterwards baptized by Athelstan, king
of England. The heathen Vikings often pretended to
take up Christianity, to renounce it again on the first
opportunity. Some of them allowed themselves to be baptized
over and over again, merely for the sake of the
white garments. Others, who visited Christian lands for
the sake of traffic or as mercenary soldiers, used to let
themselves be primsegnet (marked with the sign of the
cross) without being baptized. Thus they were on a good
footing with the foreign Christians, and also with their
heathen brethren at home. Many of those who were
baptized in all sincerity quite misunderstood the meaning
of the rite, thinking that it would release them from evil
spirits and gramary.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
